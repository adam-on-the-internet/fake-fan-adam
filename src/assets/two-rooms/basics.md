- Drunk: Before the cards are dealt but after they are shuffled, remove one card randomly. This is the "sober" character card. Place the "sober" card facedown in a location easily accessible to all players (usually between the 2 rooms). Then shuffle the Drunk card into the remaining deck. At the beginning of the last round, the Drunk should trade their Drunk card fo the "sober" card. You lose if you forget or are unable to trade your card for the "sober" card.
