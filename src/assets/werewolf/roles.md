The Assassin does not have to be alive at the end of the game in order to win.
If the Assassin wins, other teams can still win as well.

**The Assassin is on his own team.**

## Aura Seer

## Bodyguard

- Wake: n/a | Team: Villager | Set: Daybreak
- Vote: Whoever they "vote" for cannot be killed.

- Wake: 1-A & 1-F | Team: Alien | Set: Bonus

Wakes up and looks for other aliens, then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card, 
and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien, regardless of what team the role was on before.
(If the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien Team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher Card is also an alien.

## Cow

If any alien is sitting next to the Cow, one alien must tap her on the fist.

## Copycat

- Wake: -8 | Team: Special - Any | Set: Vampire

Wakes up and must look at one of the center cards.
From that point on in the game, the Copycat is the role they viewed.

- Prep: Place the Mark of the Fear and the Mark of the Vampire in the Marks Board

Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire players, taking that player's original Mark 
(without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty vampire spot.

He also wakes up after the Vampires have closed their eyes, and must place the Mark of Fear on any non-Vampire 
(he may not place it on the player who has the Mark of the Vampire, as that player is now a Vampire).

[To learn what each Artifact does, view the "Artifacts" page of the Compendium.](/view/werewolf~artifacts)

## Cursed

- Wake: n/a | Team: Special - Villager / Werewolf / Vampire | Set: Bonus

On the village team, unless at least one Werewolf or a Vampire votes for him,
and then he becomes a Werewolf of a Vampire and join the werewolf or vampire team. 
This means that if the Cursed receives the most votes, and at least one of those votes is from a Werewolf or a Vampire, 
the village team will win.

**The Cursed is on the Villager team, unless at least one werewolf or vampire votes for them, in which case the Cursed is on that team.**

## Diseased

- Wake: -5 | Team: Villager | Set: Vampire
- Prep: Place the Mark of Disease in the Marks Board

The Diseased wakes up and must place the Mark of Disease face down on a player adjacent to them, 
returning that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down to the Marks boards.

Any player who votes for the Diseased player (or the player with the Mark of the Disease) cannot win, even if their team wins.
However, any vote cast against this player still counts, and if the Diseased/Mark of the Disease player gets the most votes, 
they die just like any other player, and players on the winning team who did *not* vote for the Diseased/Mark of the Diseased players win.

## Doppelgänger

- Wake: -7 | Team: Special - Any | Set: Werewolf
- Prep: If playing with Marks, put out the secondary Marks. If playing with a Sentinel, prepare a secondary shield token.

*The Doppelgänger is a very complicated role that changes based on the other roles in the game.*

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one player's card and then changes based on the card they see.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, they are the role that the Doppelgänger originally viewed.

[To learn what each card does to the Doppelgänger, view the "Doppelgänger" page of the Compendium.](/view/werewolf~doppelganger)

**The Doppelgänger's team depends on what card they see.**

## Dream Wolf

- Wake: 2 | Team: Werewolf | Set: Daybreak

Does *not* fully wake up with the other Werewolves. 
When the Werewolves are called, he sticks out his thumb so that the other Werewolves know who he is.
When playing with the Minion, the Dream Wolf sticks out his thumb during the Minion's night phase.

## Drunk

- Wake: 8 | Team: Villager | Set: Werewolf

Wakes up and must exchange their Drunk card for any card in the center, but they do *not* look at their new card.

## Empath

## Exposer

- Wake: 10-B | Team: Villager | Set: Alien

Wakes up and may flip one, two, or three of the center cards by turning them over and leaving them that way.

## Gremlin

- Wake: 7-D | Team: Villager | Set: Vampire

## Groob & Zerb

- Wake: 1-A & 1-D | Team: Special - Alien / Own | Set: Alien

Wakes up and looks for other aliens, then wakes up again later and looks for each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game, they have a different win condition: Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive, and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the village team wins as well, since at least one alien was killed.
Any other aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game, they are on the alien team as normal.

**Groob and Zerb are on the alien team, unless both are in the game, in which case they are on their own teams.**

## Hunter

- Wake: n/a | Team: Villager | Set: Werewolf
- Vote: If they die, whoever they voted for dies as well.

If the player with the Mark of the Traitor is the only person on his team,
the Mark of the Traitor has no effect.

## Leader

- Wake: 3-C | Team: Special - Villager / Leader | Set: Alien

Wakes up, and all palyers who are aliens keep their eyes closed and put out their thumbs.
If both Zerb and Groob are in the game and saw each other when they woke up, they point at each other (with their eyes closed) instead of putting out their thumbs.

If Zerb and Groob are *not* both in the game, the Leader wins with the village team.

If both Zerb and Groob are in the game, the Leader is on their own team and only wins both Zerb and Groob are alive at the end of the game.

In addition, the villager team loses and the alien team wins if all players on the alien team (including Zerb and Groob, if either or both are in the game) point to the Leader, even if an Alien is killed.

**The Leader is on the village team, unless Zerb and Groob are both in the game, in which case the Leader only wins if both Groob and Zerb survive.**

## Marksman

- Wake: 5-D | Team: Villager | Set: Vampire
- Prep: Setup the Marks Board

The Marksman wakes up and may view one player's card and/or another player's Mark 
(but not the same player if viewing both a Mark and a card).

## Mason

- Wake: 4 | Team: Villager | Set: Werewolf

The Masons wakes up and looks for the other Mason. 

## The Master

- Wake: -6 | Team: Vampire | Set: Vampire
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Vampire in the Marks Board

The Master wakes up with the Vampires. 
Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire player, 
taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

The Master's special power occurs during the vote: 
if another Vampire (the regular Vampire, the Count, or the player with the Mark of the Vampire) votes for him, 
the Master is protected and cannot be killed.
Instead, the player with the 2nd most votes (greater than 1) is killed.

## Minion

- Wake: 3 | Team: Special - Werewolf / Minion | Set: Werewolf

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are.
During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. 
The Werewolves don't know who the Minion is.
If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. 
If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (**not** the Minion) dies.

## Mortician

- Wake: 13-A | Team: Special - Mortician | Set: Alien

Wakes up and may look at one, both, or none of their neighbors (based on what the app tells them to do).
The Mortician needs more business, and on top of that they're really lazy, so they win if at least one of their neighbors 
(the players directly adjacent to them) dies.
The Mortician wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

**The Mortician is on his own team.**

## Mystic Wolf

- Wake: 2, 2-C | Team: Werewolf | Set: Daybreak

Wakes with the other Werewolves.
Afterwards, the Mystic Wolf wakes up separately and may look at one other player's card.

## Nostradamus

- Wake: 5-E | Team: Special - Any | Set: Bonus

Nostradamus wakes up and may look at 1, 2, or 3 cards.
The last card he looks at is the team he is on.
When he has looked at his last card, he must tap that role on the app; the app then tells the players Nostradamus's team.

Nostradamus wins if he lives *and* the team he is on wins. If he is on the werewolf/vampire/alien team, he is not a werewolf/vampire/alien
(so if he dies he will not cause the team he is on to lose, even though Nostradamus themself won't win).

**Nostradamus is on the team of the last card he looks at (which he taps on the app).
If he does not look at a card or choose a card in the app, the app will choose a team for him.
If a player receives the Nostradamus card from the center cards, he is on the team that the app has chosen for him.**

## Oracle

- Wake: -9 | Team: Villager | Set: Alien

The App asks the Oracle a question.
She responds by tapping an answer on the app.

If he views a Werewolf or Tanner, he may not view any more cards, and he becomes a Werewolf or Tanner, respectively.

If the P.I. sees the Doppelgänger that saw a Werewolf, he continues looking 
(he doesn't know what the Doppelgänger saw, and does not become what the Doppelgänger saw, even if they Doppelgänger saw a Werewolf or Tanner).

**The Paranormal Investigator is on the Village team, unless he finds a Werewolf, in which case he joins the werewolf team, or if he finds a Tanner, in which case he becomes a Tanner and only wins if he dies.**

## Pickpocket

Votes for the Prince do not count. 
If the Prince receives the most votes, the player who receives the next largest amount of votes (greater than one) dies.

## Renfield

- Wake: -6-C | Team: Special - Vampire / Villager | Set: Vampire

If Renfield is in the game, the Vampires must point at the player with the Mark of the Vampire when they close their eyes, and leave their fingers pointing until Renfield closes his eyes.
Renfield wakes up and sees who the Vampires are and who they are pointing at.
Then Renfield must take the Mark of the Bat and place it in front of him face down, placing his original Mark (without looking at it) face down on the empty Bat spot on the Marks board.
Renfield wins as long as no Vampires are killed, even if Renfield himself dies.

If the Mark of the Bat ends up on another player, it has no effect on that player.

**Renfield is on the vampire team (but he is not a Vampire), unless no players are Vampires (or have the Mark of the Vampire), in which case he is on the villager team.**

## Revealer

- Wake: 10 | Team: Villager | Set: Daybreak

Wakes up and may flip any other player's card face up.
If a Werewolf or Tanner is showing, he must flip it over again face down.
If the Revealer reveals a Doppelgänger or Paranormal Investigator card, he leaves it face up. 
The Revealer only flips one card face up, even if he finds a Werewolf or Tanner.

## Robber

- Wake: 6 | Team: Villager | Set: Werewolf

## Squire

- Wake: 9-C | Team: Special - Werewolf / Squire | Set: Bonus

Wakes up and learns who the Werewolves are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Squire may then view the cards of the Werewolves.
If no players are Werewolves, the Squire wins as long as one other player (*not* the Squire) dies.

## Synthetic Alien

- Wake: 1-A | Team: Special - Synthetic | Set: Alien

Wakes up and looks for other aliens.
Even though he is an Alien, he has a different win condition.
His programming leads him to realize that his technology is too powerful for the aliens or villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.
If the Syntehtic dies, everyone of the alien and villager teams lose.

When the app refers to "Aliens" it includes the Synthetic Alien, even though they are on a different team.

**The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.**

## Tanner

- Wake: n/a | Team: Special - Tanner | Set: Werewolf

Only wins if they die.
If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do *not* win.
If the Tanner dies and the Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too.

The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), 
so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses.
