# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Doppelgänger

## Doppelgänger and Werewolf Roles

**Villager, Tanner, Hunter:** She is now that role and does nothing else at night.

**Werewolf or Mason:** She wakes up with the other Werewolves or Masons when they are called.
She is on the werewolf team if she views a Werewolf, and is on the village team if she views a Mason.

**Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk:** She immediately does that role's action (she does *not* wake up again with the original role when called).

**Minion:** At the end of the Doppelgänger phase, the Announcer tells the Doppelgänger to close her eyes unless she is now the Minion, and that werewolves should put their thumbs up.
She is on the Werewolf team.

**Insomniac:** After Insomniac closes her eyes, the Doppelgänger-Insomniac is woken up to check her card to see if she is still the Doppelgänger.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, she is the role the Doppelgänger originally viewed.

The Doppelgänger script at night is a little different than most, as she has to be told to look for werewolves if she is the Minion, and is woken up later at night if the Insomniac is present.

## Doppelgänger and Daybreak Roles

Even though your group of players might be very comfortable using the Doppelgänger with the original *Werewolf* roles, we suggest that you play with the new roles *without* the Doppelgänger before playing with her.

The Doppelgänger does the following based on what she sees (roles marked with a ~ are night actions that the Doppelgänger does immediately):

**~Sentinel:** The Doppelgänger-Sentinel may immediately place a shield token on another player's card (not her own).

**~Alpha Wolf:** The Doppelgänger-alpha Wolf immediately exchanges the Center Werewolf card with any player except hers or the Alpha Wolf's (but does not look at either card).
When the Werewolves are called, the Doppelgänger-Alpha Wolf wakes up with the rest of the Werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Alpha Wolf is called.

**~Mystic Wolf:** The Doppelgänger-Mystic Wolf may immediately look at any player's card.
When the werewolves are called, she wakes up with the rest of the werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Mystic Wolf is called.

**~Apprentice Seer:** The Doppelgänger-Apprentice Seer may immediately view on of the center cards.
She does *not* wake up when the Apprentice Seer is called.

**~Paranormal Investigator:** The Doppelgänger-P.I. may immediately look at the other players' cards, one at a time, up to two of them.
If she sees a werewolf she must stop, and then she becomes a werewolf.
She does *not* wake up when the P.I. is called.

**~Witch:** The Doppelgänger-Witch may immediately look at a center card, and if she does that she must exchange it for any player's card without looking at that player's card.
She does *not* wake up when the Witch is called.

**~Villager Idiot:** The Doppelgänger-Village Idiot may immediately move all players cards to the left or right. She does *not* wake up when the Village Idiot is called.

**Revealer:** The Doppelgänger-Revealer wakes up towards the end of the night, immediately after the Revealer goes to sleep, and may flip over any player's card that is face down;
if that card is a Werewolf or Tanner, it must be flipped back over face down. She does *not* wake up when the original Revealer is called.

**Curator:** The Doppelgänger-Curator wakes up towards the end of the night, immediately after the Curator goes to sleep, and may place an Artifact token face down on any player's card, except a card that already has a shield or another token on it.
She does *not* wake up when the original Curator is called.

**Bodyguard:** She is now that role and does nothing else at night. When it comes time to vote, the Doppelgänger-Bodyguard's "vote" protects whichever player she is pointing at.

**Dream Wolf:** The Doppelgänger-Dream Wolf is on the werewolf team but she does not wake with the other werewolf team, but instead puts her thumb out when the Werewolves are called at night.

The script for the Doppelgänger is more complex depending on which *Daybreak* roles you have in place.
If she sees a no-wake role (Bodyguard or Dream Wolf) or a regular night action role (Sentinel, Alpha Wolf, Mystic Wolf, Apprentice Seer, P.I., Witch, Village Idiot),
you may use the standard script from the original *Werewolf* game.
If she views the Revealer or Curator, she'll need to wake again right after those roles wake up.

## Doppelgänger and Vampire Roles

When playing with the Doppelgänger (from the *Werewolf* set),
place an additional set of Marks (referred to as "Doppelgänger Marks" below) on the other side of the Marks boards;
these are for use specifically and only by the Doppelgänger if she needs to use a Mark.
There is no Doppelgänger Mark of the Vampire.

Roles marked with a ~ are actions that the Doppelgänger does immediately.

**~Copycat:** The Doppelgänger-Copycat does *nothing* and instead becomes the role that the Copycat views
(but does not wake up at night when the Copycat uses his new center card night power, if any).

**Vampire:** The Doppelgänger-Vampire wakes up with the other Vampires.

**The Master:** The Doppelgänger-Master wakes up with the other Vampires.
If a Vampire (including the original Master) points at the Doppelgänger-Master, the Doppelgänger-Master will not die.
If the Doppelgänger-Master points at the Master, the Master will not die.

**The Count:** The Doppelgänger-Count wakes up with the other Vampires.
She wakes up after the Count and must place the Doppelgänger Mark of Fear on any player.

**Renfield:** The Doppelgänger-Renfield wakes up after Renfield (in this case, the Vampires never lower their hands, and continue pointing at the recipient of the Mark fo the Vampire after Renfield closes his eyes).
She must take the Doppelgänger Mark of the bat and places it on herself.

**~Diseased:** The Doppelgänger-Diseased must place the Doppelgänger Mark of Disease on an adjacent player when she first wakes up.

**~Cupid:** The Doppelgänger-Cupid may place the two Doppelgänger Marks of Love on any two players when she first wkaes up;

The Apprentice Assassin doesn't know who the Doppelgänger-Assassin is, but wins if either the Assassin or the Doppelgänger-Assassin is killed.

The Assassin and Doppelgänger-Assassin both win if any player with the Mark of the Assassin both win if any player with the Mark fo the Assassin dies
(even if that was not he Mark of the Assassin that they originally placed in front of a player).
