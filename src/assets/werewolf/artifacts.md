# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Artifacts

- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

There are different Artifact tokens that can be placed on any player's card by the Curator.
When the night phase is over, any player with an ARtifact token on his card must immediately secretly look at his token.
A player with an Artifact token may not show that token to anyone else.
However, they may say anything about that token that they want to:
they may say what it actually is, they may lie, etc.

All artifact tokens override the card they are placed on; the Artifacts that change your role also take away any special power you might have
at the end of the game (for instance, if your card is the Bodyguard and you receive the Brand of the Villager, the person you point at gets a vote and is not protected, because you are a villager and not a Bodyguard anymore).

Artifact tokens that change a player's role also remove the Hunter's power and Tanner's winning condition if the token owner had one of those cards.

A token that is the same as your card (for instance, receiving a Clay of the Werewolf token on top of your Werewolf card) doesn't really do anything.
However, you often can't be sure if your card was changed; but if it was, the token overrides that.

During setup, all of the Artifact tokens should be placed face down and shuffled,
and the stack of face-down Artifact tokens should be placed near the center cards so the Curator can easily reach them.

You may choose to include only some of the Artifacts instead of all of them, based on your personal perference.
