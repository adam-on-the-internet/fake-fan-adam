# One Night Ultimate Vampire

In *One Night Ultimate Vampire*,
the sun has just set, and vampires have descended on your sleepy little town,
slowly turning the villagers into even more vampires.
Fortunately, the village has several residents with special powers, with most of them willing to help eliminate this fanged menance!

## For Players of The Original One Night Ultimate Werewolf Game

*Vampire* includes changes fro mthe original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game and its sequel *Daybreak*.
Be sure to read the Getting Started Guide before you
jump in and start playing.
The sections indicated below highlight some of the differences between the *Werewolf* games and *Vampire*.

**Setup:**
*Vamipre* requires some additional setup. See Setup below.

**Dusk:**
Dusk is a period before the regular night roles take their actions.
See "Dusk" below.

**Marks:**
Marks are additional tokens given to everyone at the start of the game.
They can change during the "Dusk" period.
See "Marks" below.

**Assassin and Apprentice Assassin:**
The Assassin and Apprentice Assassin are two new teams that can win in conjunction with another team.
See the "Assassin" and "Apprentice Assassin" sections below.

**Vamipres and Werewolves in the same game:**
It is possible to have both Vampires and Werewolves playing,
but if this happens some of the rules change slightly.
See the "Epic Battles" section below.

See the last page of these rules for more information
about *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* and *Daybreak*.

## Setup

When playing *Vampire*, you may use any combination of roles, but always include three more role cards than there are players.
Each player receives one card
(face down, which they look at secretly)
and one Mark of Clarity, which is placed face down near their card.
While you may use any number of Vampires,
we recommend using any combination of two Vampires for the best results.

Place the three extra cards in the center of the table face down.

Below the 3 cards in the center,
place the Marks boards.
Place the corresponding Marks above these boards,
and flip Marks that are in the game face *down*.

## Dusk

In *Vampire*, several roles take their action before the "regular"
*One Night* roles that take their action at night.

Dusk is when the Copycat, Vampires, Diseased, Cupid,
Instigator, Priest, Assassin, and Apprentice Assassin
all wake up and perform their actions.

At the end of Dusk,
before Night begins,
all players open their eyes and view their Marks.
They then close their eyes and all roles with Night actions are called in order.

## Marks

In *Vampire*, each player is given a Mark of Clarity at the start of the game.
During the "Dusk" phase,
additional Marks may enter the game,
changing one or more players' Marks to a different Mark.
During the Night phase, the Pickpocket and the Gremlin may
move players' Marks,
and the Marksman may view a player's Mark.

No player may ever have more than one Mark;
as soon as a player gives a Mark to a player,
the receiving player's Mark is returned to the empty spot on the Marks boards.

The Mark of the Vampire is given to any player (except an existing Vampire)
by the Vampires who wake up together.
The player who receives this is now a Vampire,
but they can still use their Night or vote action.
If the Master ends up with this Mark, he still has his Master voting power.
If Renfield ends up with this Mark, he is a vampire.

The Mark of Fear is given to a non-Vampire player by The Count
(it may not be given to the same player who was given the Mark of the Vampire).
The Player who receives this may not do their night action
(however, they may still do their Dusk action, as they won't know that they have this Mark until after Dusk).

Renfield takes the Mark of the Bat and replaces his current Mark with it.
The Mark does not have any other special power.

The Diseased gives the Mark of Disease to either the player
to the left or to the right of themselves.
Any player who votes for the player with the Mark of Disease cannot win,
though the player with this Mark can win.

Cupid hands out two Marks of Love to any two players.
Immediately after Dusk, players with this Mark wake ot see
who is in love with them.
If a player with a Mark of Love dies,
the other player with the Mark of Love dies too,
even if that player was protected during the vote
(for instance, if The Master has a Mark of Love, and the other player with a Mark of Love dies,
The Master dies too,
even if a Vampire was pointing at him during the vote).

Players who are in love are woken up after Dusk, and before the regular night actions take place.

The Instigator chooses a player who will be a traitor to his team
by giving them the Mark of the Traitor.
The player with this Mark only wins if a player on his team dies.
If he is the only player on his team,
the Mark of the Traitor has no effect.

One Mark of Clarity is dealt out face down to each player before the game begins.
Marks of Clarity are also used by the Priest to remove other Marks.
Players with this Mark have their role and team defined by their current card.

The Assassin gives the Mark of the Assassin to any player.
The Assassin only wins if the player who has this Mark is killed.

## Playing with the Vampire Roles

This section describes all of the roles in *One Night Ultimate Vampire*, and also explains
how they interact with roles from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game and its sequel, *Daybreak*.

For the roles below, "Vampire" includes the regular Vampire,
The Master, and The Count.
If any Vampire is killed at the end of the game, the vampire team loses.

If you're a *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* veteran, play *Vampire*
first with no Werewolves.
Once you get the hang of how the Marks work,
you can add Werewolves (see the section "Epic Battles" for more details on combining the games).

### Copycat

### Vampire

### The Master

### The Count

### Renfield

### Diseased

### Cupid

### Instigator

### Priest

### Assassin

### Apprentice Assassin

## Night

### Players in Love

### Marksman

### Pickpocket

### Gremlin

## Artifacts & Vampire

Artifacts are tokens that are gien to a player by the Curator, a role available in *Daybreak*.
Artifacts can be found in *Daybreak*, *Bonus Pack 1*, and *Bonus Pack 2*.

When playing with Artifacts,
role-changing Artifacts
(like the Claw of the Werewolf) always override a player's card *and* Mark.
For instance, the *Cudgel of the Tanner* Artifact
overrides the Mark of the Vampire (which overrode the team of that player's original card),
making that player a Tanner and *not* a Vampire.

All other Marks affect the role that the Artifact has changed the player into (if any).

If you are using all the Artifacts, you could end up with an Epic Battle
(because there might be Vampires, Werewolves, and Villagers in the same game).
If this happens, refer to the section on Epic Battles to determine the winner(s).

The Bodyguard and Dream Wolf from *Daybreak* are never woken up at night.
The Cursed and Prince from *Bonus Pack 1* are never woken up at night.

## Epic Battles: Vampires vs Villagers vs Werewolves

You can have Vampires, Villagers, and Werewolves
(from *One Night* and *Daybreak*), in the same game.

If all three are in the game and active
(i.e. actually in front of at least one player,
not just in the center card group),
at least two players will be killed during the vote:
the player with the most votes and the player with the 2nd most votes
(in this case 1 vote counts if it is the 2nd highest number).
If there is a tie for most votes, only those tied for the most votes are killed.
If there isn't a tie for the most votes, and there is a tie for 2nd most votes, the person with the most votes is killed
and those with the 2nd most votes are also killed.
If it is determined that either Werewolves, Vampires, or Villagers were not in play (because those cards were in the center),
then only the player(s) with the most votes
(as long as they have at least 2) are killed.
Both of the win conditions below must be fulfilled for each team to win:

- Vampire Team
  - At least 1 Werewolf must be killed
  - No Vampires may be killed
- Villager Team
  - At least 1 Vampire must be killed
  - At least 1 Werewolf must be killed
- Werewolf Team
  - At least 1 Vampire must be killed
  - No Werewolves may be killed

In cases where all Werewolves, Vampires or village team members are in the center,
winning conditions are normal, and only one player is killed.

## Special Cases when Combining Games

If the Prince (*Bonus Pack 1*) has the Mark of the Vampire, he is a Vampire and on the vampire team,
but he cannot die.

If the Cusred (Bonus Pack 2*) has the Mark of the Vampire, and a Werewolf points at him during the vote,
he's still a Vampire.

If the Bodyguard (*Daybreak*) has the Mark of the Vampire,
the player he points at still cannot be killed.

If a player has the Shield token from the Sentinel
(*Daybreak*), only his card is protected, not his Mark

If the Copycat card *starts* as a Center card,
and is later given to a player by a card like the Drunk (*One Night*)
or the Witch (*Daybreak*),
that player is on the village team and has no special power.

A player with the Mark of Fear may not do any part of their night action,
including openning their eyes.
However, if another night action requires that you put out your thumb, you must do that.
The exception to this is that the Dreamwolf (*Daybreak*)
with a Mark of Fear cannot put out his thumb initially when Werewolves wake,
but most put out his thumb for the Minion (*One Night*) or Squire (*Bonus Pack 2*).

If a Werewolf (*One Night*) has the Mark of the Vampire,
he still wakes up with the other Werewolves,
but he is a Vampire and wins with the Vampire team.

If there is no Mark of the Assassin in the game,
the Assassin is a simple villager, and wins with the Village team.
this can happen if the Assassin card starts in the middle and is given to a player via
the Witch (*Daybreak*), Drunk (*One Night*), or another role.

When playing Epic Battles,
if all Werewolves are in the center, but at least one player
is a Minion (*One Night*)
or Squire (*Bonus Pack 2*), only one player dies during the vote
(because there are no Werewolves).

to help track who has the most votes, use the included doublesided #1 and #2 tokens,
giving them to the player(s) who receive the most and 2nd-most votes.
