# One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak

## Getting Started Guide

The *One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Daybreak* game
can be played alone or with the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game.
We recommend playing a few games using the roles in the base game *before*
you play games that include the *Daybreak* roles.
You may combine any of the *Daybreak* roles with the roles
in the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game,
or use just *Daybreak* roles.

The rules below assume you have never played *One Night* before.
If you are familiar with the *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game, 
there's no need to read this Getting Started Guide.

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Daybreak*, each player takes on a role on either the werewolf or the village team.
It's your job to figure out who the wolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win...
unless you've become a wolf yourself!

Unlike many other games,
the real fun in *Daybreak* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night,
where all of the players may have performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on
(because your role card might have been switched),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who *isn't* on your team;
the player(s) that receives the most votes is "killed."
If a wolf is killed, everyone on the village team wins.
If no wolves are killed, the werewolf team wins.

The more you play *Daybreak*, the more you'll realize how important it is to wait until
just the right time to reveal information, and how important it can be to lie, regardless of what team you started on.

Because the game is so short,
you'll probably end up playing multiple games.
Because *Daybreak* is so different,
it may take a few games until you get into the flow of figuring out what to say when,
and soon you'll realize that events of previous games have an
undeniable impact on the current game in terms of how players behave, who they believe, and what their real motivations are.

## First Game Setup

Setup differs based on the number of players 
(for more than 7 players you'll need to add the cards from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game).
For your first game, it's recommended that you play a 3 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay
(If you have more players, don't worry. The  game is very quick and everyone else will enjoy watching).

Include the following cards:

- 1 Alpha Wolf
- 1 Apprentice Seer
- 1 Village Idiot
- 1 Mystic Wolf
- 1 Revealer

Shuffle these cards face down and deal one to each player.
Put the remaining three cards and tokens that match all the cards being used
in the center of the table.
Take the Dream Wolf card and place it face down turned 90 degrees next to the center cards.

Each player should secretly view their card, and place it face down near the three cards in the center
of the table.
All players should be able to reach all cards easily, as shown below:

## Night

There are several roles that are called on at night to do a night action.

In addition to have a role card, one player is designated the Announcer
and announces each of the roles in order and silently counts to ten after each role is 
woken up to allow the players with that role to perform their action at night.
You can avoid having someone do announcing duties by using the free app (see below).

Use this script for your first 3-player game:

> Announcer: "Everyone, close your eyes."
>
> *All players close their eyes (including the Announcer).*
>
> "Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves. If you are the only Werewolf, you may look at one of the center cards."
>
> *The werewolves (both the Alpha Wolf and the Mystic Wolf) open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open. If only one Werewolf wakes up, he or she may look at one of the center cards.*
>
> "Werewolves, close your eyes. Alpha Wolf, wake up and exchange the center Werewolf card for any other player's card."
>
> *The Alpha Wolf opens his eyes and exchanges the center Dream Wolf card with another player's card.*
>
> "Alpha Wolf, close your eyes. Mystic Wolf, wake up. You may look at one other player's card."
>
> *The player with the Mystic Wolf card opens her eyes and may look at one other player's card.*
>
> "Mystic Wolf, close your eyes. Apprentice Seer, wakes up. You may look at one of the center cards."
>
> *The player with the Apprentice Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one of the cards in the center.*
>
> "Apprentice Seer, close your eyes. Witch, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards. If you do, you must exchange that card with any player's card."
>
> *The player with the Witch card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one of the cards in the center. If she does, she must exchange that card with any player's card.*
>
> "Witch, close your eyes. Village Idiot, wake up. You may move everyone's card but your own one to the left or to the right."
> 
> *The player with the Village Idiot card opens his eyes and may quietly move everyone else's card to the left or move everyone's card to the right.*
>
> "Village Idiot, close your eyes. Revealer, wake up. You may flip over any other player's card. If it is a Werewolf, flip it over face down."
> 
> *The player with the Revealer card opens his eyes and may quietly flip any other player's card over so it is face up. If it is a Werewolf, it must be flipped again face down.*
> 
> "Revealer, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and move your card around slightly. Everyone, wake up!"
> 
> *All players open their eyes and look around suspiciously.*

At night,
players who are not active (whose eyes are closed)
may not move, point, or do anything to communicate with the active player(s).

## Day

After the night phase,
players discuss amongst themselves who they believe the Werewolves are.
All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone.
Werewolves might want to claim to be a different role so that they don't die.

Because certain roles change other players' cards,
some players will believe they are one role,
when they are actually a different one.
After the night phase, your role is the card that is currently in front of you,
which may be different than your original role.
*No one may look at any cards after the night phase.*

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.

> "Everyone, three, two, one, VOTE!"
>
> *Each player points to another player*

The player with the most votes dies and reveals his card.
In case of a tie,
all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.
If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies.
One way the player might achieve this is if everyone votes
in the same direction around the table, with each player receiving one vote (decide this as a group before you vote).

## Game End

After just one night and day...

The Village team wins:

- 1) If at least one Werewolf (including the Mystic Wolf, Alpha Wolf, or Dream Wolf) dies. Even if one or more players who are *not* Werewolves die in addition to a Werewolf dying, everyone on the village team wins.
- 2) If no one is a Werewolf and no one dies. It is possible for one one to be a Werewolf if all Werewolf cards are in the center.

The werewolf team only wins if at least one player is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.

## Announcer Tips

As the Announcer,
place any tokens with numbers on them near you,
and open your eyes in between roles if you need to check the night wake order.
Otherwise keep your eyes closed during the night.
You may want to tap on the table during the night to cover up any sounds made by the different players
when they are looking at and moving cards.
If you call your own role,
don't speak while performing your action.

When introducing players to the game for the first time,
or introducing new roles,
be sure to pause during the "action" section of each role you call to give players enough time to decide what to do and
to complete their action.

## Get the Free App

Instead of having an Announcer,
you can use the free app for iOS and Android devices available at www.beziergames.com.
This app calls out the roles you're using in order,
provides some background noise,
and also has a timer for the day phase.
You can even set it to move quickly once the players are comfortable with all the roles.

## Other Tips

The length of time it takes for discussion during the day phase is up to the players.
With larger groups, you'll need a bit more time than with smaller groups.
After a few plays with a few larger groups,
consider using a timer like the one that is included with the free app;
when the timer goes off, everyone must vote.
This adds a sense of urgency to the discussions, and will result in less non-relevant conversations during the day.

Playing with higher player numbers (7+)
can make it difficult for everyone to reach the center of the table.
Standing at the table during the Night phase can make reaching easier,
and using a smaller table can also help.
If you have to use a long "banquet" table,
try to position the players on the long sides of it, and *not* the ends.

For the roles that wake and look for each other,
you can also stick out your thumb when waking;
this makes it easier for everyone who wakes to spot the other players who are awake.

## Using Other Roles

To use additional roles in subsequent games just take out a card and replace it with a different one.
You may use virtually any combination of cards,
though you probably don't want to introduce more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time, so players can easily understand them.

Regardless of which roles are present, you must always have 3 more cards than players.

Before each round,
place a token that corresponds to each of the cards near the Announcer.
The numbers on the tokens correspond to the night wake order
(you can see the full list on the back page).
This way everyone will know what roles are in the game,
and the Announcer will know in what order to call them.

Be creative in your role selection:
Try having a single Werewolf, or shuffling *all* of the cards and
dealing them out to players entirely randomly!
