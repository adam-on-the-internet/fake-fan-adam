# One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak*,
there's been an outbreak of werewolves in your town,
and all of them have special powers.
Fortunately, the village has all sorts of amazing roles to help them figure out
who those werewolves are!

## Playing with the Daybreak Roles

This section describes all of the roles in *Daybreak*, and also explains
how they interact with the roles from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game.

For the roles below, "Werewolf" includes the Alpha Wolf,
Mystic Wolf, and Dream Wolf.

If you're a *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* veteran,
add a few of the *Daybreak* roles to each game until you become comfortable with them.

## Roles that Wake Up at Night

### Sentinel

### Alpha Wolf

### Mystic Wolf

### Apprentice Seer

### Paranormal Investigator

### Witch

### Village Idiot

### Revealer

### Curator

## No-Wake Roles

### Bodyguard

### Dream Wolf

## Artifacts

There are different Artifact Tokens that can be placed on any player's card by the Curator.
When the night phase is over, any player with an Artifact token on his card must immediately secretly look at his token.
A player with an Artifact token may not show that token to anyone else.
However, they may say anything about that token that they want to: 
they may say what it actually is, they may lie, etc.

All Artifact tokens override the card they are placed on; the Artifacts that change your role
also take away any special power you might have at the end of the game (for instance,
if your card is the Bodyguard and you receive the Brand of the Villager, 
the person you point at gets a vote and is not protected, because you are a Villager and not a Bodyguard anymore).

Artifact tokens that change a player's role also remove the Hunter's power 
and the Tanner's winning condition if the token owner had one of those cards.

A token that is the same as your card (for instance,
receiving a Claw of the Werewolf token on top of your Werewolf card)
doesn't really do anything.
However, you often can't be sure if your card was changed; but if it has, the token overrides that.

During setup, all of the Artifact tokens should be placed face down and shuffled, and the stack of face-down Artifact tokens
should be placed near the center cards so the Curator can easily reach them.

You may choose to include only some of the Artifacts instead of all of them, based on your personal preference.

The following is a list of Artifacts:

**Claw of the Werewolf:**
You are now a Werewolf.

**Brand of the Villager:**
You are no a Villager, with no special abilities.

**Cudgel of the Tanner:**
You are now a Tanner.
You only win if you die.
If you die, the werewolf team cannot win.
If a Werewolf *and* you both die, both you and the village team wins.

**Void of Nothingness:**
This artifact has no effect.

**Mask of Muting:**
You may not speak. You may use hand motions, sign language, etc. as long as you are silent.

**Shroud of Shame:**
You must turn your chair, body, and face
away from the other players.
You may still speak,
but you may not look at the other players
or the cards and tokens.
You may not turn around when voting,
but you may (try to) point at any player
(the other players will determine who you pointed at).

## Doppelgänger and Daybreak

Even though your group of players might be very comfortable using the Doppelgänger with the original
*One Night Ultimate Werewolf* roles,
we suggest that you play *without* the Doppelgänger before playing with her.

The Doppelgänger does the following based on what she sees (roles marked with ! are night actions that the Doppelgänger does immediately):

**Sentinel!:**
The Doppelgänger-Sentinel may immediately place a shield token on another player's card (not her own).

**Alpha Wolf!:**
The Doppelgänger-Alpha Wolf immediately exchanges the Center Werewolf card with any player except hers or the Alpha Wolf's
(but does not look at either card).
When the Werewolves are called, the Doppelgänger-Alpha Wolf wakes up with the rest of the Werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Alpha Wolf is called.

**Mystic Wolf!:**
The Doppelgänger-Mystic Wolf may immediately look at any player's card.
When the werewolves are called, she wakes up with the rest of the Werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Mystic Wolf is called.

**Apprentice Seer!:**
The Doppelgänger-Apprentice Seer may immediately view one of the center cards.
She does *not* wake up when the Apprentice Seer is called.

**Paranormal Investigator!:**
The Doppelgänger-P.I. may immediately look at other players' cards,
one at a time, up to two of them.
If she sees a Werewolf or Tanner she must stop, and then she becomes a Werewolf or a Tanner.
She does *not* wake up when the P.I. or Werewolves are called.

**Witch!:**
The Doppelgänger-Witch may immediately look at a center card, and if she does that she must exchange
it for any player's card without looking at that player's card.
She does *not* wake up when the Witch or Werewolves are called.

**Village Idiot!:**
The Doppelgänger-Village Idiot may immediately move all player cards to the left or right.
She does *not* wake up when the Village Idiot is called.

**Revealer:**
The Doppelgänger-Revealer wakes up towards the end of the night,
immediately after the Revealer goes to sleep, and may flip over any player's card that is face down;
if that card is a Werewolf or Tanner, it must be flipped back over face down.
She does *not* wake up when the original Revealer is called.

**Curator:**
The Doppelgänger-Curator wakes up towards the endo fthe night,
immediately after the Curator goes to sleep, and may place an Artifact token
face down on any player's card,
except a card that already has a shield or another token on it.
She does *not* wake up when the original Curator is called.

**Bodyguard:**
She is now that role and does nothing else at night.
When it comes time to vote,
the Doppelgänger-Bodyguard's "vote"
protects whichever player she is pointing at.

**Dream Wolf:**
The Doppelgänger-Dream Wolf is on the Werewolf team but she does not wake with the other Werewolves,
but instead puts her thumb out when the Werewolves are called at night.

The script for the Doppelgänger is more complex depending on which *Daybreak* roles you have in place.
If she sees a no-wake role
(Bodyguard or Dream Wolf) or a regular  night actin role 
(Sentinel, Alpha Wolf, Mystic Wolf, Apprentice Seer, P.I., Witch, Village Idiot),
you may use the standard script from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game.
If she views the Revealer or the Curator,
she'll need to wake up again right after those roles wake up.

If the Revealer and Doppelgänger are both in play, use the following Script after the Revealer:

> "Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Revealer card, wake up and turn any card face up.
> If the card you reveal is a Werewolf or a Tanner, turn it back over face down."
>
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and turns over any player's card.
> If it is a Werewolf or a Tanner, she flips it over face down again.*
>
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

If the Curator and Doppelgänger are both in play,
use the following Script after the Curator:

> "Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Curator card, wake up and place an Artifact token on any card."
>
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and places an Artifact token face down on any player's card which 
> does not already have a token on it.*
>
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

## Playing with More than 10 Players

If you have more than 10 players who want to play,
and you have both *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*
and *Daybreak*,
consider splitting into two groups, with each group playing a separate game.

If you want to have a giant game with more than 10 people all playing together,
you'll want one person who isn't playing to stand/sit near the cards to show/move cards as each player wakes up.
When a player wakes up, they point to the card(s) to be shown/moved,
and the non-player does that action for them.
Trying to fit more than 10 people around a table where everyone wants to reach the center of the table can be challenging otherwise.

## Fun Scenarios

While you can mix any set of roles together and still have a great time playing,
the following are a few sets that we've found particularly engaging
during hundreds of playtest sessions.
The player counts are the minimums; you can add other roles to these sets to match the number of players
(remember you need 3 more cards than players).

### At least 3 players

**Evil Transformation:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Mystic Wolf, Minion, Robber, Witch

**Trust No One:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Dream Wolf, Robber, Witch, Tanner

### At least 4 players

**Cautionary Tale:** Werewolf, Mystic Wolf, Seer, Apprentice Seer, Revealer, Hunter, Bodyguard

### At least 5 players

**Information Society:** Werewolf, Mystic Wolf, Seer, Apprentice Seer, Paranormal Investigator, Witch Insomniac, Revealer

**Total Chaos:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Werewolf, Robber, Witch, Troublemaker, Village Idiot, Curator

## Night Wake Order with Daybreak & One Night

The following is a list of all the roles that are woken at night from both the original 
*One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game as well as *Daybreak*, and the order they should be woken relative to each
other (only call the roles that are in your game):

- #0: Sentinel
- #1: Doppelgänger
