# One Night Ultimate Werewolf

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or a special character.
It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win...unless you've become a Werewolf yourself!

## One Night Roles

You may use additional roles in your games beyond the basic setup.
Just take out a card and replace it with a different one.
You may use virtually any combination of cards, though you probably don't want to introduce more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time, so players can easily learn them.

Regardless of which roles are present, you must always have 3 more cards than players.

Before each round, place a token that corresponds to each of the cards in the center of the table.
This will ensure that everyone knows what roles are in the game.

Each of the roles has certain effects which change the nature of the game.
Some roles clearly help the village team, like the Seer or Mason, while others help the werewolf team, like the Minion.
Don't be too concerned if one team seems to be winning too much; gameplay with One Night tends to evolve over the course of several games.

Be creative in your role selection:
Try having a single Werewolf, or shuffling *all* of the cards and dealing them out to players entirely randomly!
You can even create a village with no Villager cards...that way everyone has a special role.

The free app makes using the different roles very easy; the app allows you to choose exactly which roles are in the game
(that wake up at night),
and then reads them in the correct order,
and even takes care of anomalies for things like when there is a Doppelgänger and Minion in the game.

## Roles That Wake Up At Night

These roles wake up at night in the following order (see the chart on the back page for a summary).
Within each of the role descriptions is a sample script which the Announcer may use:

### Doppelgänger

The Doppelgänger is a fairly complicated card, because she takes on the role and team of whatever card she views.
If you haven't played with most of the other roles yet, skip this section for now...it will make a lot more sense then.

The Doppelgänger wakes up before the other *One Night* roles.

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one other player's card and does the following based on what she sees:

**Villager, Tanner, Hunter:**
She is now that role and does nothing else at night.

**Werewolf or Mason:**
She wakes up with the other Werewolves or Masons when they are called. She is on the werewolf team if she views a Werewolf, and is on the village team if she views a Mason.

**Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk:**
She immediately does that role's action (she does not wake up again with the original role when it is called).

**Minion:**
At the end of the Doppelgänger phase, the Announcer tells the Doppelgänger to close her eyes unless she is now the Minion,
and that werewolves should put their thumbs up.
She is on the Werewolf team.

**Insomniac:**
After the Insomniac closes her eyes, the Doppelgänger-Insomniac is woken up to check her card to see if she is still the Doppelgänger.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night,
she is the role the Doppelgänger originally viewed.
The Doppelgänger's script at night is a litle different than most,
as she has to be told to look for werewolves if she is the Minion,
and is woken up later at night if the Insomniac is present. Use the following script if there is no Minion in the game:

> "Doppelgänger, wake up and look at another player's card.
> You are now that role.
> If your new role has a night action, do it now."
> 
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at one other player's card. If the viewed card is the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, or Drunk,
> she does that action right now.
> If the viewed card is a Werewolf or Minion, she wakes up when those roles are called.
> If the viewed card is a Villager, Tanner, or Hunter, she does nothing.*
> 
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

If there is a Minion in the game, use this script:

> "Doppelgänger, wake up and look at another player's card.
> You are now that role. 
> If your new role has a night action, do it now."
> 
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at one other player's card.
> If the viewed card is the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, or Drunk,
> she does that action right now.
> If the viewed card is a werewolf or Mason, she wakes up when those roles are called.
> If the viewed card is a Villager, Tanner, or Hunter, she does nothing.*
> 
> "If you are now a Minion, keep your eyes open. Otherwise, close them.
> Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Doppelgänger-Minion can see who you are."
> 
> *If the Doppelgänger is a Minion, she keeps her eyes open;
> otherwise, she closes them.
> The Werewolves stick out a thumb for the Doppelgänger-Minion to see.*
> 
> "Werewolves, put away your thumbs away. Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

If there is an Insomniac in the game, after the Insomniac has been called, use the following script:

> "Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Insomniac card, wake up and look at your card."
> 
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at her card to see if it has changed during the night.*
> 
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

### Werewolf

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves.
If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center.
*Werewolves are on the Werewwolf team.*

> "Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves."
> 
> *The Werewolves open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others)*
> 
> "Werewolves, close your eyes."

*Lone Wolf Option:* If there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card.
This is extremely beneficial to a Werewolf who doesn't have a partner, and provides him with a useful tool for deceiving the rest of the players.

### Minion

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are.
During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are.
The Werewolves don't know who the Minion is.
If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win.
If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (*not* the Minion) dies.
*This role can be a very powerful ally for the Werewolf team.*

> "Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are."
> 
> *The Minion opens his eyes. The Werewolves stick out a thumb for the Minion to see.
> The Minion looks around to see which players are Werewolves.*
> 
> "Werewolves put your thumbs away.
> Minion, close your eyes."

### Mason

When using the Masons always put *both* Masons in the game.
The Mason wakes up at night and looks for the other Mason.
If the Mason doesn't see another Mason,
it means the other Mason card is in the center.
*Masons are on the village team.*

> "Masons, wake up and look for other Masons."
> 
> *The Masons open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others).*
> 
> "Masons, close your eyes."

### Seer

At night, the Seer may look at either one other player's card or at two of the center cards,
but does not move them.
*The Seer is on the village team.*

> "Seer, wake up. You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards."
> 
> *The player with the Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one other player's card or any two of the cards in the center.*
> 
> "Seer, close your eyes."

### Robber

At night, the Robber may choose to rob a card from another player and place his Robber card where the other card was.
Then the Robber looks at his new card.
The player who receives the Robber card is on the village team.
*The Robber is on the team of the card he takes,* however, he does not do the action of his new role at night.

If the Robber chooses *not* to rob a card from another player, he remains the Robber and *is on the village team.*

> "Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card, and then view your new card."
> 
> *The player with the Robber card opens his eyes and may quietly exchange his card for another player's card, which he looks at.*
> 
> "Robber, close your eyes."

### Troublemaker

At night, the Troublemaker may switch the cards of two *other* players without looking at those cards.
The players who receive a different card are now the role (and team) of their new card, even though they don't know what role that is until the end of the game.
*The Troublemaker is ont he village team.*

> "Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two players."
> 
> *The player with the Troublemaker card opens her eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two other players without looking at those cards.*
> 
> "Troublemaker, close your eyes."

### Drunk

The Drunk is so drunk that he doesn't remember his role.
When it comes time to wake up at night,
he must exchange his Drunk card for any card in the center, but he does *not* look at it.
The Drunk is now the new role in front of him (even though he doesn't know what that new role is) and is on that team.

> "Drunk, wake up and exchange your card with a card from the center."
> 
> *The player with the Drunk card opens his eyes and exchanges his card for one of the three center cards, but does not view his new card.*
> 
> "Drunk, close your eyes."

### Insomniac

The Insomniac wakes up and looks at her card (to see if it has changed).
Only use the Insomniac if the Robber and/or the Troublemaker are in the game.
*The Insomniac is ont he village team.*

> "Insomniac, wake up and look at your card."
> 
> *The player with the Insomniac card opens her eyes and looks at her own card to see if it has changed during the night.*
> 
> "Insomniac, close your eyes."

## No-Wake Roles

### Villager

The Villager has no special abilities, but he is definitely not a werewolf.
Players may often claim to be a Villager.
*The Villager is on the village team.*

### Tanner

The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die.
The Tanner only wins if he dies.
If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do *not* win.
If the Tanner dies and a Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too.
The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team),
so if the Tanner dies when all Werewolves are in the center, the village team loses.
*The Tanner is not on the Werewolf or the villager team.*

### Hunter

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes his target receives).
*The Hunter is on the village team.*
