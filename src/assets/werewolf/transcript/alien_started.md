# One Night Ultimate Alien

## Get the App!

Alien requires the free One Night app to play.
Go to beziergames.com to get the app for your iOS or Android device.

## Getting Started Guide

In *One Night Ultimate Alien(TM)*, you play as an Alien or a Villager.
You don't choose your role- you play the hand you're dealt.

Villagers win if they can kill just one Alien.
Aliens, being from another world, have a bunch of weird ways to win.
But mostly,
Aliens win if no Aliens get killed.

(Don't worry. This will all make sense soon.)

Your role gives you secret information about other players' identities.
Once everyone has had a chance to learn something, you'll talk among yourselves to try to decide who's an Alien
and who's a Villager.
Then you'll all vote on who to kill!

It's a quick, addictive game, so you'll have time for several rounds in just one evening.
Every time you play, you'll learn more for the next time: 
what to say, what not to say, when to be honest, and when to... *not* be honest.

Pay attention to what other people are saying,
and who's not talking at all.

Don't worry if a game doesn't go your way.
You'll have another chance in just a few minutes!

Now turn the page and get started with setup.

## First Game Setup

[Image of cards arranged. Three cards in the center labelled "Face down role cards in the center". Four cards around the center cards labelled "Player role card", each next to one numbered token #1-#4 labelled "Player number token". Seven tokens next to the center cards labelled "Role tokens (one for each role card in the round)"]

While one person reads the rest of this section,
have someone else download the free *One Night* app from beziergames.com onto an Android or iOS device.

Setup differs based on the number of players.
For your first game,
it's recommended that you player a 4 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay.
If you have more players, don't worry- the game is very quick and everyone else will enjoy watching.

Include the following cards:

- 2 Aliens
- 1 Synthetic Alien
- 1 Cow
- 1 Psychic
- 1 Rascal
- 1 Exposer

Shuffle these cards face down and deal one to each player.
Put the other three cards face down in the center of the table, and place tokens for *all* of the cards in play nearby so everyone can reach them.

Each player should take a Player Number token (with four players, use tokens 1-4), and place it in front of them where everyone can see it.

Each player should secretly view their card,
and place it face down near the three cards in the center of the table.
All players should be able to reach all cards easily, as shown above.

## The Free App

In order to play *Alien*,
you'll need the free *One Night* app,
available at beziergames.com.
Unlike other *One Night* games,
the app is _required_ in order to play *Alien*.

To use the app,
simply select the roles that are in the game and press the Play button...
the app will do the rest for you.

## Night

The first thing that will happen is that the app will tell everyone to close their eyes,
which everyone must do.

Then the roles are called, one by one, with the app explaining what each role may or may not do at night,
and eventually players will be told to wake up,
at which point you can open your eyes.

## Day

After the Night phase,
players discuss amongst themselves who they believe the Aliens are.
All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone (or look at their card themselves).
Aliens usually want to claim to be a different role so that they don't die.

Because certain roles (like the Rascal) may change other players' cards,
some players will believe they are on e role,
when they are actually a different one.
After the night phase, your role is determined by the card that is currently in front of you,
which may be different than your original role.
*No one may look at any cards after the night phase.*

After a few minutes of discussion, the app will tell players to vote.
This is done by each player pointing at another player (players may never point at themselves or away from all players, and each player must vote).

The player with the most votes dies and reveals his card.
In case of a tie, all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.
If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies.
One way the players might achieve this is if everyone votes in the same direction around the table,
with each player receiving one vote (you might decide this as a group before you vote).

## Game End

After just one night and one day...

The village team wins:

- 1) If at least one Alien dies. Even if one or more players who are *not* Aliens dies in addition to a Alien dying, everyone on the village team wins.
- 2) If no one is an Alien and no one dies. This is possible if both Alien cards are in the center.

The Alien team wins if at least one player is an Alien and no Aliens are killed.

The Synthetic Alien wins and all other teams lose if he dies.
He loses if he is alive at the end of the game.

If your team does not meet the win conditions above, then your team loses.

## Other Tips

The length of time it takes for discussion during the Day phase
is up to the players, and can be set in the app in the "Game Timer" section
(press and hold the Game Timer icon to access those controls).
For your first few games,
we recommend setting the timer to 1 minute less than the number of players.
When the timer goes off,
everyone must vote for another player.
Keeping the time short adds a sense of urgency to the discussions,
and will result in less non-relevant conversations during the day.

For the roles that wake and look for each other,
you can also stick out your thumb when waking;
this makes it easier for everyone who wakes to spot the other players who are awake.

## Using Other Roles

To use additional roles in subsequent games just take out a card and replace it with a different one prior to shuffling and dealing the cards.
You may use virtually any combination of cards, though you probably don't want to introduce more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time,
so players can easily understand them.

Regardless of which roles are present,
you must always have 3 more cards than players.

## Wake Order

The following is a list of the roles that are woken at night from *Alien*, and the order they should be woken relative to each other.

- -9: Oracle
- 1-A: Aliens/Synthetic/Groob/Zerb
  - 1-C: Cow
  - 1-D: Groob & Zerb
- 3-C: Leader
- 5-G: Psychic
- 7-F: Rascal
- 10-B: Exposer
- 13: Blob
- 13-A: Mortician

Does this numbering system seem weird to you?
See page 5 of the rulebook for a complete explanation!
