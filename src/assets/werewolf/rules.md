- [Back to Compendium](/#/view/view/werewolf~compendium)

## Overview

- 4-10 players (Best with 6-8)
- About 10 minutes per game
- Social Deduction

## Gameplay

### Setup

#### Select Roles

Choose the roles you'd like to play with. 
For a typical game, you'll select 3 more roles than you have players and just use one main "enemy" team 
(Werewolves, Vampires, or Aliens).
After you've selected roles, select them in the Werewolf app and 
make sure you have the matching role cards and role tokens.
You may want to switch out one or more roles between rounds of the game.

#### Special Role Setup

If any roles you selected have extra setup, do that now. To name a few, not all, cases:

- when using the Sentinnel, you'll need to place a shield token near the center
- when using the Curator, you'll need to set all (or just your preferred) Artifacts near the center
- when using characters who use Marks from Vampire, you'll need to setup the Marks boards
- when using characters from Alien, you'll need to give each player a number token

#### Deal the Role Cards

Shuffle the Role Cards and deal one to each player, placing the remaining cards in the center of the table next to each other.
Each player then checks their role in secret. 
The role they see tells them what actions they will have during the Night.
If their role changes overnight, they will wake up as a different role for the Day.

#### Talk Through the Roles

Before starting, you'll often also want to talk through what each role does with all the players and any special rules that are in play.
When possible, it may help to write information about the selected roles on a nearby white board or other surface.

#### Start the App

Configure any special settings for the game (role timer, vote timer, music, randomization, etc).
If you're playing with roles from *Alien*, make sure the App is reachable by all players
When you're satisfied, hit Start.

### Night Phase

#### Close Your Eyes

Everyone closes their eyes to start the Night Phase.

#### Dusk Actions

If any selected roles have Dusk Actions, the App will tell them to wake up and do things.

#### Dusk Wake-Up

When playing with Marks from Vampire, all players wake up after Dusk to check their Marks in secret. 
They do *not* look at their role cards.

#### Night Actions

If any selected roles have Night Actions, the App will tell them to wake up and do things.

#### Wake Up

Everyone moves their card around slightly and opens their eyes.
Nobody views their cards (or Marks, if Vampire roles are in selected).
If the Curator is in play and gave someone an Artifact, the player with the Artifact immediately looks at their Artifact in secret.

### Day Phase

#### Discussion

Once everyone is awake, the Timer is started.
Players have a set amount of time to talk amongst themselves and try to ascertain what happened over night,
what role they are now for the Day phase, 
how they can win,
and who they're going to vote for.

#### Vote

After the Timer ends, or if the players all agree, players vote all at once.
Players vote by pointing at one other player. 
They must point at another player, they cannot point at nobody or themselves.

#### Figure Out Who Died & Who Died

Count up how many votes everyone got. 
If you have the #1 and #2 vote tokens (included with some games),
give those to the players with #1 and #2 most votes.

Flip over all cards (and Artifacts and Marks if they're in the game) 
to see if any special vote powers came into play that may affect who dies.

The player with the most votes, with more than one vote, dies. 
If players are tied for the most votes, all players tied for the most votes die.
If no player has more than one vote, nobody dies.

Now that you know everyone's final role and who died, figure out who won based on the different Team's win conditions.

## Epic Battles

An Epic Battle happens when three or more main teams 
(Villagers, Werewolves, Vampires, and Aliens)
are in the game and active 
(in front of at least one player, not just in the center).

Epic Battles have slightly different rules.

In Epic Battles, the player(s) with the most votes *and* the player(s) with the 2nd most votes are killed, 
even if 1 vote is the second highest number.

In Epic Battles, all of the following win conditions must be fulfilled for a main team to win:

- Villager Team
  - At least 1 player from two different teams must be killed
- Werewolf Team
  - At least 1 Vampire or 1 Alien must be killed
  - No Werewolves may be killed
- Vampire Team
  - At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Alien must be killed
  - No Vampires may be killed
- Alien Team
  - At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Vampire must be killed
  - No Aliens may be killed

In Epic Battles, when four teams are in play, it is possible to have more than one team win.
Colluding with other teams for mutual victory is encouraged.

In Epic Battles, all other teams retain their original win conditions
(for instance, the Tanner and the Blob).

## Variants, Special Cases, and More

- Artifacts override Marks; Marks override Role cards.
- If the Doppelg√§nger or Copycat didn't look at another card for another reason (for instance, if they were in the center) they are on the Village team.
- Lone Wolf Option: If there is only one Werewolf on the Werewolf team at Night, that Werewolf may view one center card.

- To make ascertaining what happened overnight more difficult, you may add extra center cards or have other roles that are shuffled in but left out of the center in a stack.
- To keep what is happening overnight secret, you may choose to add background noise such as having players tap on the table throughout the night. You may also but a blanket or towel on the table to reduce noise.
