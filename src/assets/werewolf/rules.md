# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Rules

- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

## Overview

- 4-10 players (Best with 6-8)
- 10 minutes per game
- Social Deduction

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or another special character.
It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win... unless you've become a werewolf yourself!

Unlike many other games, the real fun in *One Night* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night, where many of the players
performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on (because your role card might have been switched with another role card),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who *isn't* on your tea; the player that receives the most votes is "killed".
If a Werewolf is killed, everyone on the village team wins. 
If no Werewolves are killed, the Werewolf team wins.

## Gameplay

- TBD

## Voting Rules - "Day Phase"

After the Night Phase has ended and everyone has woken up,
players discuss who they believe the werewolves (and/or other characters) are.
All players may say anything, but may not show their card (or look at their card)
unless the rules say otherwise.

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.

- Each player gets one vote and cannot vote for themselves.
- The player with the most votes dies.
- In the case of a tie, all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.
- If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies. (One way to achieve this is if everyone votes in the same direction around the table.)

## Special Cases

- TBD

## Epic Battles: Aliens V Villagers V Werewolves V Vampires

You can have Aliens, Villager, Werewolves, and Vampires in the same game.

If 3 or more of these groups are in the game and active (i.e. actually in front of at least one player, not just in the center card group),
at least *two players* will be killed during the vote: 
the player with the most votes and the player with the second-most votes
(in this case one vote counts if it is the second-highest number).

If there is a tie for most votes, only those tied for the most votes are killed.
If there isn't a tie for the most votes, and there is a tie for the second-most votes,
the person with the most votes and those with the second-most votes are also killed.
If it is determined that only two of these groups are in play (because the other cards were in the center),
then only the player(s) with the most votes (as long as they have at least two) are killed. 
All win conditions must be fulfilled for each team to win:

Villager Team Epic Battle Win Conditions:
- At least 1 player from *two* different non-villager teams must be killed

Alien Team Epic Battle Win Conditions:
- At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Vampire must be killed
- No Aliens may be killed

Vampire Team Epic Battle Win Conditions:
- At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Alien must be killed
- No Vampires may be killed

Werewolf Team Epic Battle Win Conditions:
- At least 1 Vampire or 1 Alien must be killed
- No Werewolves may be killed

When four teams are in play, more than one team can win.
For instance, if a Villager and a Vampire are killed, both the Alien and the Werewolf team win.
Colluding with another team to try to get the numbers is encouraged, but it might just out you and result in your team losing!

All other (special) teams, such as the Tanner, retain their original win conditions.
