# One Night Ultimate Werewolf Guide

This is a fan-made consolidation of the rules for Bézier Games *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* series.

To purchase the games, check out [Bézier Games website](https://beziergames.com/).

## Overview

- 4-10 players (Best with 6-8)
- 10 minutes per game
- Social Deduction

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or another special character.
It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win... unless you've become a werewolf yourself!

Unlike many other games, the real fun in *One Night* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night, where many of the players
performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on (because your role card might have been switched with another role card),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who *isn't* on your tea; the player that receives the most votes is "killed".
If a Werewolf is killed, everyone on the village team wins. 
If no Werewolves are killed, the Werewolf team wins.

## Roles

###  Alien

- Team: Alien
- Set: Alien

Aliens (including "regular" Aliens, Synthetic, Groob, and Zerb) wake up and look for each other.
Then the app directs the Aliens as to what to do next.

In some cases, the Aliens may have the ability to change a player into an Alien.
In this particular case, the player remains an Alien, regardless of what their card is.

**The Alien is on the alien team.**

### Alpha Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

If playing with the Alpha Wolf, position any other Werewolf card (including a regular Werewolf, the Mystic Wolf, or Dream Wolf) 
face down and pperpendicular to the three center cards. 
At night, the Alpha Wolf wakes up with the other Werewolves. Afterwards, the Alpha Wolf wakes up separately.
The Alpha Wolf *must* exchange the Center Werewolf card with any othe rplayer's card (but not his own card or another Werewolf's card), without looking at either card.

All roles that can view or move a center card may also view or move the Center Werewolf card.

**The Alpha Wolf is on the werewolf team.**

### Apprentice Assassin

- Team: Special - Apprentice Assassin
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Apprentice Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Apprentice Seer wakes up and may look at one of the center cards. 

**The Apprentice Seer is on the villager team.**

### Apprentice Tanner

- Team: Special - Tanner
- Set: Bonus

The Apprentice Tanner wakes up, and the Tanner puts out his thumb so the Apprentice Tanner knows who the Tanner is.

The Apprentice Tanner wins if the Tanner dies (in which case the Tanner wins too).

If there is no Tanner, the Apprentice Tanner realizes that the Tanner job is not all that after all, and only wins if he dies.

**The Apprentice Tanner is on the Tanner team.**

### Assassin

- Team: Special - Assassin
- Set: Vampire

### Aura Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

When the Aura Seer wakes up, all players who have (at that point in the night) viewed or moved any card stick out their thumbs.
If a role was called and the player did not view or move a card, that player does not stick out his thumb.

**The Aura Seer is on the Village Team.**

### Beholder

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

The Beholder wakes up and learns who the Seer and the Apprentice Seer are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Beholder may then check the cards of the Seer and Apprentice Seer.

**The Beholder is on the villager team.**

### Blob

- Team: Special - Blob
- Set: Alien

The Blob doesn't wake up, but is told which and how many players adjacent to it are now part of the Blob.
The Blob wins as long as none of the players who are part of the Blob (including the Blob player) are killed.
The Blob wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

The players the Blob must keep alive are always relative to the location of the Blob card at the end of the game.

**The Blob is on its own team.**

### Bodyguard

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

When everyone votes, the player that the Bodyguard points to cannot be killed. 
If that player received the most votes, the player with the next most votes (at least two) is killed.
Recommended for five or more players.

When the Bodyguard is in the game, it is necessary for all players to turn their cards over right after the vote (to see if the Bodyguard is pointing to the player with the most votes).

**The Bodyguard is on the villager team.**

### Body Snatcher

- Team: Alien
- Set: Bonus

The Body Snatcher wakes up with the Aliens, and then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card, and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien, regardless of what team the role was on before.
(If the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien Team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher Card is also an alien.

**The Body Snatcher is on the alien team.**

### Cow

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Cow sticks out their fist while the aliens are awake.
If any alien is sitting next to the Cow, one alien must tap her on the fist, which tips her.

### Copycat

- Team: Special - ?
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### The Count

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

The Count wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire players, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty vampire spot.

He also wakes up after the Vampires have closed their eyes, and must place the Mark of Fear on any non-Vampire (he may not place it on the player who has the Mark of the Vampire, as that player is now a Vampire).
The Mark of Fear prevents a player from using their Night action (if they have one).

**The Count is on the vampire team.**

### Cupid

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Curator

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Curator wakes up and may choose and place a random face down Artifact token (without looking at it)
on any player's card (including his own). See the Artifact list for information about the tokens and their effects.

The Curator may not place an Artifact token on a card that has a shield token on it.

**The Curator is on the villager team.**

### Cursed

- Team: Special - Villager or Werewolf or Vampire
- Set: Bonus

The Cursed does not wake up at night. The Cursed is on the village team, unless at least one Werewolf or a Vampire votes for him,
and then he becomes a Werewolf of a Vampire and join the werewolf or vampire team. This means that if the Cursed receives the most votes, and at least one of those votes is from a Werewolf or a Vampire, the village team will win.

**The Cursed is on the Villager team, unless at least one werewolf or vampire votes for them, in which case the Cursed is on that team.**

### Diseased

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Doppelgänger

- Team: ?
- Set: Werewolf

- TBD

### Dream Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

The Dream Wolf does *not* wake up with the other Werewolves. 
When the Werewolves are called, he sticks out his thumb so that the other Werewolves know who he is.
When playing with the Minion, the Dream Wolf sticks out his thumb during the Minion's night phase.

**The Dream Wolf is on the Werewolf team.**

### Drunk

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

The Drunk is so drunk that they don't remember their role.
When it comes time to wake up at night, they must exchange their Drunk card for any card in the center, but they do *not* look at their new card.
The Drunk is now the new role in front of him (even though he doesn't know what that new role is) and is on that team.

### Empath

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

The Empath wakes up, and watches as certain players do things (as determined by the app).

**The Empath is on the villager team.**

### Exposer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Exposer wakes up and may flip one, two, or three of the center cards by turning them over and leaving them that way.
The number of cards turned over is determined by the app.
If the Exposer is told that he may flip two cards, he must flip two or none at all.
If he is told that he may flip three cards, he must flip three or none at all.

**The Exposer is on the villager team.**

### Gremlin

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Groob & Zerb

- Team: Alien or Own
- Set: Alien

Groob and Zerb wake up with the aliens, and then wake up together later and look at each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game, they have a different win condition: Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive, and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the village team wins as well, since at least one alien was killed.
Any other aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game, they are on the alien team as normal.

**Groob and Zerb are on the alien team, unless both are in the game, in which case they are on their own teams.**

### Hunter

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes their target receives).

**The Hunter is on the villager team.**

### Insomniac

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

The Insomniac wakes up and looks at their card (to see if it has changed). 
Only use the Insomniac if the Robber and/or the Troublemaker are in the game.

**The Insomniac is on the village team.**

### Instigator

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Leader

- Team: Special - Village or Leader
- Set: Alien

- TBD

### Marksman

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

-TBD

### Mason

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

When using the Masons, always put *both* Masons in the game.
The Mason wakes up at night and looks for the other Mason. If the Mason doesn't see the other Mason, it means the other Mason card is in the center.

**Masons are on the villager team.**

### The Master

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

The Master wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire player, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

The Master's special power occurs during the vote: if another Vampire (the regular Vampire, the Count, or the player with the Mark of the Vampire) votes for him, the Master is protected and cannot be killed.
Instead, the player with the 2nd most votes (greater than 1) is killed.

**The Master is on the Vampire team.**

### Minion

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Werewolf

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes upa nd sees who the Werewolves are.
During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. The Werewolves don't know who the Minion is.
If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. 
If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (**not** the Minion) dies.
This role can be a very powerful ally for the werewolf team.

**The Minion is on the Werewolf team.**

### Mortician

- Team: Special - Mortician
- Set: Alien

The Mortician wakes up and may look at one, both, or none of their neighbors (based on what the app tells them to do).
The Mortician needs more business, and on top of that they're really lazy, so they win if at least one of their neighbors (the players directly adjacent to them) dies.
The Mortician wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

**The Mortician is on his own team.**

### Mystic Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

The Mystic Wolf wakes with the other Werewolves.
Afterwards, the Mystic Wolf wakes up separately.
The Mystic Wolf may look at one other player's card.

**The Mystic Wolf is on the werewolf team.**

### Nostradamus

Team: Special - Any
Set: Bonus

Nostradamus wakes up and may look at 1, 2, or 3 cards.
The last card he looks at is the team he is on.
When he has looked at his last card, he must tap that role on the app; the app then tells the players Nostradamus's team.

Nostradamus wins if he lives *and* the team he is on wins. If he is on the werewolf/vampire/alien team, he is not a werewolf/vampire/alien
(so if he dies he will not cause the team he is on to lose, even though Nostradamus themself won't win).

**Nostradamus is on the team of the last card he looks at (which he taps on the app).
If he does not look at a card or choose a card in the app, the app will choose a team for him.
If a player receives the Nostradamus card from the center cards, he is on the team that the app has chosen for him.**

### Oracle

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Oracle wakes up and the app asks her a question.
She responds by tapping an answer on the app. If she does not respond for any reason (including if the card is in the center), the app chooses an answer for her.

**The Oracle is on the villager team.**

### Paranormal Investigator

- Team: Special - ?
- Set: Daybreak

- TBD

### Pickpocket

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

- TBD

### Priest

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

### Prince

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

The Prince does not wake up at night. Votes for the Prince do not count. 
If the Prince receives the most votes, the player who receives the next largest amount of votes (greater than one) dies.

**The Prince is on the village team.**

### Psychic

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Psychic wakes up and the app tells her to look at one or more cards.
Which cards may be viewed can be different for each game.

**The Psychic is on the village team.**

### Rascal

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Rascal wakes up and the app tells them if they may (or must) move two or more cards.
Which cards may be moved can be different for each game.

**The Rascal is on the village team.**

### Renfield

- Team: Special - Vampire or Villager
- Set: Vampire

If Renfield is in the game, the Vampires must point at the player with the Mark of the Vampire when they close their eyes, and leave their fingers pointing until Renfield closes his eyes.
Renfield wakes up and sees who the Vampires are and who they are pointing at.
Then Renfield must take the Mark of the Bat and place it in front of him face down, placing his original Mark (without looking at it) face down on the empty Bat spot on the Marks board.
Renfield wins as long as no Vampires are killed, even if Renfield himself dies.

If the Mark of the Bat ends up on another player, it has no effect on that player.

**Renfield is on the vampire team (but he is not a Vampire), unless no players are Vampires (or have the Mark of the Vampire), in which case he is on the villager team.**

### Revealer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Revealer wakes up and may flip any other player's card face up.
If a Werewolf or Tanner is showing, he must flip it over again face down.
If the Revealer reveals a Doppelgänger or Paranormal Investigator card, he leaves it face up. The Revealer only flips one card face up, even if he finds a Werewolf or Tanner.

**The Revealer is on the villager team.**

### Robber

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

At night, the Robber may choose to rob a card from another player and place his Robber card where the other card was.
Then the Robber looks at their new card. The player who receives the Robber card is on the village team.

**The Robber is on the team of the card he takes, however, he does not do the action of his new role at night.**

**If the Robber choose *not* to rob a card from another player, he remains the Robber and *is* on the village team.

### Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

At night, the Seer may look either at one other player's card or at two of the center cards, but does not move them.

**The Seer is on the village team.**

### Sentinel

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Sentinel wakes upa nd may place a shield token on any player's card except his own.
That card may not be viewed or moved, and may not have an artifact placed on it.

The Sentinel's shield prevents the Witch, Robber, Drunk, and Insomniac from viewing or moving their own card (if it is shielded).
While the Drunk's power is normally mandatory, a shield on the Drunk's card prevents the Drunk from using his power.

During setup, a shield token should be placed near the center cards so the Sentinel can easily reach it.

**The Sentinel is on the village team.**

### Squire

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Bonus

The Squire wakes up and learns who the Werewolves are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Squire may then view the cards of the Werewolves.
If no players are Werewolves, the Squire wins as long as one other player (*not* the Squire) dies.

**The Squire is on the Werewolf team.**

### Synthetic Alien

- Team: Special - Own
- Set: Alien

The Synthetic Alien wakes up with the aliens. Even though he is an Alien, he has a different win condition.
Due to the self-awareness he is programmed with, he realizes that his advanced technology is too powerful for the aliens to wield, and too dangerous for the villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.
If the Syntehtic dies, everyone of the alien and villager teams lose.

When the app refers to "Aliens" it includes the Synthetic Alien, even though they are on a different team.

**The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.**

### Tanner

- Team: Special - Tanner
- Set: Werewolf

The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die.
The Tanner only wins if he dies.
If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do *not* win.
If the Tanner dies and the Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too.

The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses.

**The Tanner is on the Tanner team, not the Werewolf or Villager team.**

### The Thing (That Goes Bump in the Night)

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

The Thing wakes up and may tap the nearest shoulder of either the player on his left or the player on his right.

**The Thing is on the villager team.**

### Troublemaker

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

At night, the Troublemaker may switch the cards of two *other* players without looking at those cards.
The players who receive a different card are now ht role (and team) of their new card, even though they don't know what role that is until the end of the game.

**The Troublemaker is on the villager team.**

### Vampire

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

Vampires (including The Master and The Count) wake up and look for other Vampires.
Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one other non-Vampire player, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

**The Vampire is on the Vampire team**

### Village Idiot

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Village Idiot wakes up and may move *all* player's cards but his own one place to the left or move *all* player's cards but his own one place to the right.
If he chooses to move cards, he must always move all player's cards *except* his own card, the center cards, and any cards with a shield token on them.

**The Village Idiot is on the villager team.**

### Villager

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

The Villager has no special abilities, but he is definitely not a werewolf.
Players may often claim to be a villager.

**The Villager is on the village team.**

### Werewolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Werewolf

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves.
If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center

Lone Wolf Option - If there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card. This is extremely beneficial to a Werewolf who doesn't have a partner, and provides him with a useful tool for deceiving the rest of the players.

**Werewolves are on the werewolf team.**

### Witch

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Witch wakes up and may look at one of the center cards.
If she *does* look at a center card, then she *must* exchange that card with any player's card (including her own card),
placing that player's card back in the center (in the same location without looking at it).

**The Witch is on the village team, unless she replaces her own card with a card from a different team.**
