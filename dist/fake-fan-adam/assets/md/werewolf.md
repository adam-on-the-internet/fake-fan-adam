### Vampires

#### The Count

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

The Count wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire players, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty vampire spot.

He also wakes up after the Vampires have closed their eyes, and must place the Mark of Fear on any non-Vampire (he may not place it on the player who has the Mark of the Vampire, as that player is now a Vampire).
The Mark of Fear prevents a player from using their Night action (if they have one).

**The Count is on the vampire team.**

#### The Master

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

The Master wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire player, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

The Master's special power occurs during the vote: if another Vampire (the regular Vampire, the Count, or the player with the Mark of the Vampire) votes for him, the Master is protected and cannot be killed.
Instead, the player with the 2nd most votes (greater than 1) is killed.

**The Master is on the Vampire team.**

#### Vampire

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

Vampires (including The Master and The Count) wake up and look for other Vampires.
Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one other non-Vampire player, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

**The Vampire is on the Vampire team**

### Aliens

#### Body Snatcher

- Team: Alien
- Set: Bonus Roles

The Body Snatcher wakes up with the Aliens, and then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card, and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien, regardless of what team the role was on before.
(If the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien Team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher Card is also an alien.

**The Body Snatcher is on the alien team.**

#### Groob & Zerb

- Team: Alien or Own
- Set: Alien

Groob and Zerb wake up with the aliens, and then wake up together later and look at each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game, they have a different win condition: Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive, and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the village team wins as well, since at least one alien was killed.
Any other aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game, they are on the alien team as normal.

**Groob and Zerb are on the alien team, unless both are in the game, in which case they are on their own teams.**

####  Alien

- Team: Alien
- Set: Alien

Aliens (including "regular" Aliens, Synthetic, Groob, and Zerb) wake up and look for each other.
Then the app directs the Aliens as to what to do next.

In some cases, the Aliens may have the ability to change a player into an Alien.
In this particular case, the player remains an Alien, regardless of what their card is.

**The Alien is on the alien team.**

### Others

- Leader
- Copycat: Views one center card, assumes its role, takes action when called. (May change teams)
- Cursed
- Doppelganger
- Paranormal Investigator
- Apprentice Assassin
- Assassin
- Apprentice Tanner
- Tanner
- Blob
- Mortician
- Nostradamus

#### Synthetic Alien

- Team: Own
- Set: Alien

The Synthetic Alien wakes up with the aliens. Even though he is an Alien, he has a different win condition.
Due to the self-awareness he is programmed with, he realizes that his advanced technology is too powerful for the aliens to wield, and too dangerous for the villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.
If the Syntehtic dies, everyone of the alien and villager teams lose.

When the app refers to "Aliens" it includes the Synthetic Alien, even though they are on a different team.

**The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.**

#### Renfield

- Team: Vampire or Village
- Set: Vampire

If Renfield is in the game, the Vampires must point at the player with the Mark of the Vampire when they close their eyes, and leave their fingers pointing until Renfield closes his eyes.
Renfield wakes up and sees who the Vampires are and who they are pointing at.
Then Renfield must take the Mark of the Bat and place it in front of him face down, placing his original Mark (without looking at it) face down on the empty Bat spot on the Marks board.
Renfield wins as long as no Vampires are killed, even if Renfield himself dies.

If the Mark of the Bat ends up on another player, it has no effect on that player.

**Renfield is on the vampire team (but he is on a Vampire), unless no players are Vampires (or have the Mark of the Vampire), in which case he is on the villager team.**
