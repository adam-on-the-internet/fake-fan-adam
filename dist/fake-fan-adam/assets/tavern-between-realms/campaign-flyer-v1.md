# The Tavern Between Realms

The Tavern Between Realms is a place for creative minds to jump in and out of adventuring sessions without a typical campaign. The Tavern exists beyond a particular storyline or setting and allows for rotating players, game masters, systems, settings, and more.

## What is the Tavern?

The Tavern itself stands in a mostly-empty pocket universe that was created and abandoned long ago by unknown and powerful beings. The Tavern is surronded by Portals that connect to the far reaches of time and space. People of all kinds gather here between their own lives (adventurous or not). Others stay here, and may even live in this extraordinary space.

### The Tavern Story

Players will develop the Tavern from scratch and carry on its story over time. Some sessions may advance the story in ways such as hiring new bartenders for the Tavern, hiding Cursed Artifacts in the cellar, or developing a Garden beyond the Tavern's walls. Other sessions may simply use the Tavern as a jumping off point for the story- a place for characters to quickly meet and set off on a short adventure. 

### The Characters

Player Characters and Non Player Characters may be temporary for a single session, or have a story that persists in (and even beyond) the Tavern games. That makes the Tavern a suitable place for Player Characters to retire after campaigns.

## How Do Games Work?

The Gameplay is up to the Players and Game Master for each session, but many sessions will follow a similar outline.

### Sample Session Outline

## Why the Tavern?

Traditional campaigns take a lot of commitment, planning, and scheduling. Having a structure for shorter one-shot based games allows more players to play with different groups and systems, allows new players an entrypoint, and allows gamemasters new and old to experiment with tools, systems, settings, and more.

### The Tavern Grows

Tavern gameplay should change over time, aligning with whatever works best for the players. This overview is only a sample of the shape the games may take!

### Beyond the Tavern

Some games may not follow the Tavern at all, and some games may not even use roleplaying systems. In the end, the Tavern is a community of people who can jump in and out of games on a whim.
