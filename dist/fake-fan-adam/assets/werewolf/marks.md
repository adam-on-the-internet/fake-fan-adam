# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Marks

- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

In *Vampire*, each player is given a Mark of Clarity at the start of the game.
During the "Dusk" phase, additional Marks may enter the game, changing one or more players' Marks to a different Mark.
During the "Night" phase, the Pickpocket and Gremlin may move players' Marks, and the Marksman may view a player's Mark.

No player may ever have more than one Mark;
as soon as a player gives a Mark to a player, the receiveing player's Mark is returned to the empty spot in the Marks Board

## Marks

**Mark of the Vampire:** Given to any player (except an existing Vampire) by the Vampires who wake up together.
The player who receives this is now a Vampire, but they can still use their Night or vote action.
If the Master ends up with this Mark, he still has his Master voting power.
If Renfield ends up with this Mark, he is a Vampire.

**Mark of Fear:** This Mark is given to a non-Vampire player by The Count
(it may not be given to the same player who was given the Mark of the Vampire).
The Player who receives this may not do their Night action (however, they may still do their Dusk action, as they won't know they have this Mark until after Dusk).

**Mark of the Bat:** Renfield takes the Mark of the Bat and replaces his current Mark with it.
The Mark does not have any other special power.

**Mark of the Diseased:** The Diseased gives this Mark to either the player to the left or right of themselves.
Any player who votes for the player with the Mark of the Disease cannot win, though the player with this Mark can win.

**Mark of Love:** Cupid hands out two of these Marks to any two players.
Immediately after Dusk, players with this Mark wake to see who is in love with them.
If a player with a Mark of Love dies, the other player with the Mark of Love dies too, even if that player was protected during the vote
(for instance, if the Master has a Mark of Love, and the other player with a Mark of Love dies, the Master dies too, even if a Vampire was pointing at him during the vote).

Players who are in love are woken up after Dusk, and before regular Night actions take place.

**Mark of the Traitor:** The Instigator chooses a player who will be a traitor to his team by giving them this Mark.
The player with this Mark only wins if a player on his team dies.
If he is the only player on his team, the Mark of the Traitor has no effect.

**Mark of Clarity:** One of these Marks is dealt out face down to each player before the game begins.
Marks of Clarity are also used by the Priest to remove other Marks.
Players with this Mark have their role and team defined by their current card.

**Mark of the Assassin:** The Assassin gives this Mark to any player. 
The Assassin only wins if the player who has this Mark is killed.
