###  Alien

- Team: Alien
- Set: Alien

Aliens (including "regular" Aliens, Synthetic, Groob, and Zerb) wake up and look for each other.
Then the app directs the Aliens as to what to do next.

In some cases, the Aliens may have the ability to change a player into an Alien.
In this particular case, the player remains an Alien, regardless of what their card is.

**The Alien is on the alien team.**

### Alpha Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

If playing with the Alpha Wolf, position any other Werewolf card (including a regular Werewolf, the Mystic Wolf, or Dream Wolf) 
face down and pperpendicular to the three center cards. 
At night, the Alpha Wolf wakes up with the other Werewolves. Afterwards, the Alpha Wolf wakes up separately.
The Alpha Wolf *must* exchange the Center Werewolf card with any othe rplayer's card (but not his own card or another Werewolf's card), without looking at either card.

All roles that can view or move a center card may also view or move the Center Werewolf card.

**The Alpha Wolf is on the werewolf team.**

### Apprentice Assassin

- Team: Special - Apprentice Assassin
- Set: Vampire

The Apprentice Assassin wakes up immediately after the Assassin places the Mark of the Assassin in front of a player,
*while the Assassin's eyes are still open*.
The Apprentice Assassin looks for the Assassin (and the Assassin looks for her).

The Apprentice Assassin wins if the Assassin dies.
The Apprentice assassin does not have to be alive at the end of the game in order to win.

If there is no Assassin, the Apprentice Assassin must place the Mark of the Assassin in front of any player,
and only wins if the player with the Mark of the Assassin (including herself) dies.

**The Apprentice Assassin is on her own team.**

### Apprentice Seer

**The Apprentice Tanner is on the Tanner team.**

### Assassin

- Team: Special - Assassin
- Set: Vampire

The Assassin wakes up and must place the Mark of the Assassin on any player, placing that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down in the empty Assassin spot on the Marks boards.

The Assassin can only win if the player with the Mark of the Assassin dies, regardless of what that player's team is.
The Assassin does not have to be alive at the end of the game in order to win.
The Assassin is unique in that if he wins, other teams can still meet their winning conditions and win, so it is possible to have the assassin win along with the Vampires, the villagers, or even the Tanner.

If it happens that the Assassin ends up with the Mark of the Assassin at the end of the game, he only wins if he himself dies.

**The Assassin is on his own team.**

### Aura Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

When the Aura Seer wakes up, all players who have (at that point in the night) viewed or moved any card stick out their thumbs.

**The Aura Seer is on the Village Team.**

### Beholder

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

The Beholder wakes up and learns who the Seer and the Apprentice Seer are by having them stick out their thumbs.

**The Beholder is on the villager team.**

### Blob

- Team: Special - Blob
- Set: Alien

The Blob doesn't wake up, but is told which and how many players adjacent to it are now part of the Blob.

**The Bodyguard is on the villager team.**

### Body Snatcher

- Team: Alien
- Set: Bonus

The Body Snatcher wakes up with the Aliens, and then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card, and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien, regardless of what team the role was on before.
(If the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien Team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher Card is also an alien.

**The Body Snatcher is on the alien team.**

### Cow

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien

The Cow sticks out their fist while the aliens are awake.
If any alien is sitting next to the Cow, one alien must tap her on the fist, which tips her.

### Copycat

From that point on in the game, the Copycat is the they viewed.

**The Copycat is on the team they first view.**

### The Count

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire

The Count wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire players, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty vampire spot.

He also wakes up after the Vampires have closed their eyes, and must place the Mark of Fear on any non-Vampire (he may not place it on the player who has the Mark of the Vampire, as that player is now a Vampire).
The Mark of Fear prevents a player from using their Night action (if they have one).

**The Count is on the vampire team.**

### Cupid

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

Cupid wakes up and may place up to two Marks of Love face down in front of any two players,
placing those players' original Marks face down (without looking at them) in the empty Love spots on the Marks boards.

Players with the Mark of Love remain on their current teams.

**Cupid is on the villager team.**

### Curator

- Team: Villager

**The Curator is on the villager team.**

### Cursed

- Team: Special - Villager or Werewolf or Vampire
- Set: Bonus

The Cursed does not wake up at night. The Cursed is on the village team, unless at least one Werewolf or a Vampire votes for him,
and then he becomes a Werewolf of a Vampire and join the werewolf or vampire team. This means that if the Cursed receives the most votes, and at least one of those votes is from a Werewolf or a Vampire, the village team will win.

**The Cursed is on the Villager team, unless at least one werewolf or vampire votes for them, in which case the Cursed is on that team.**

### Diseased

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

The Diseased wakes up and must place the Mark of Disease face down on a player adjacent to them, returning that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down to the Marks boards.

Any player who votes for the Diseased player (or the player with the Mark of the Disease) cannot win, even if their team wins.
However, any vote cast against this player still counts, and if the Diseased/Mark of the Disease player gets the most votes, they die just like any other player, and players on the winning team who did *not* vote for the Diseased/Mark of the Diseased players win.

**The Diseased is on the villager team.**

### Doppelgänger

- Team: Special - Any
- Set: Werewolf

The Doppelgänger is a fairly complicated card, because she takes on the role and team of whatever card she views.
If you haven't played with most of the other roles yet, do not use this role yet... it will make more sense later.

The Doppelgänger wakes up before the other roles.

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one player's card and then changes based on the card they see.

[To learn what each card does to the Doppelgänger, view the "Doppelgänger" page of the Compendium.](/view/werewolf~doppelganger)

**The Doppelgänger's team depends on what card they see.**

### Dream Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

**The Dream Wolf is on the Werewolf team.**

### Drunk

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

The Drunk is so drunk that they don't remember their role.
When it comes time to wake up at night, they must exchange their Drunk card for any card in the center, but they do *not* look at their new card.

**The Exposer is on the villager team.**

### Gremlin

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

The Gremlin wakes up and may switch Marks or cards (but not both) between any two players,
but may not look at those Marks or cards.

**The Gremlin is on the villager team.**

### Groob & Zerb

- Team: Alien or Own
- Set: Alien

Groob and Zerb wake up with the aliens, and then wake up together later and look at each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game, they have a different win condition: Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive, and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the village team wins as well, since at least one alien was killed.
Any other aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game, they are on the alien team as normal.

**Groob and Zerb are on the alien team, unless both are in the game, in which case they are on their own teams.**

### Hunter

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes their target receives).

**The Hunter is on the villager team.**

### Insomniac

- Team: Villager

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

the Mark of the Traitor has no effect

**The Instigator is on the villager team.**

### Leader

- Team: Special - Village or Leader
- Set: Alien

The Leader wakes up, and all palyers who are aliens keep their eyes closed and put out their thumbs.
If both Zerb and Groob are in the game and saw each other when they woke up, they point at each other (with their eyes closed) instead of putting out their thumbs.

If Zerb and Groob are *not* both in the game, the Leader wins with the village team.

If both Zerb and Groob are in the game, the Leader is on their own team and only wins both Zerb and Groob are alive at the end of the game.

In addition, the villager team loses and the alien team wins if all players on the alien team (including Zerb and Groob, if either or both are in the game) point to the Leader, even if an Alien is killed.

**The Leader is on the village team, unless Zerb and Groob are both in the game, in which case the Leader only wins if both Groob and Zerb survive.**

### Marksman

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire

The Marksman wakes up and may view one player's card and/or another player's Mark (but not the same player if viewing both a Mark and a card).

### Mason

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

When using the Masons, always put *both* Masons in the game.

The Master's special power occurs during the vote: if another Vampire (the regular Vampire, the Count, or the player with the Mark of the Vampire) votes for him, the Master is protected and cannot be killed.
Instead, the player with the 2nd most votes (greater than 1) is killed.

**The Master is on the Vampire team.**

### Minion

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Werewolf

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes upa nd sees who the Werewolves are.
During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. The Werewolves don't know who the Minion is.
If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. 
If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (**not** the Minion) dies.
This role can be a very powerful ally for the werewolf team.

**The Minion is on the Werewolf team.**

### Mortician

- Team: Special - Mortician
- Set: Alien

The Mortician wakes up and may look at one, both, or none of their neighbors (based on what the app tells them to do).

The Mortician wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

**The Mortician is on his own team.**

### Mystic Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

Set: Bonus

Nostradamus wakes up and may look at 1, 2, or 3 cards.
The last card he looks at is the team he is on.
When he has looked at his last card, he must tap that role on the app; the app then tells the players Nostradamus's team.

Nostradamus wins if he lives *and* the team he is on wins. If he is on the werewolf/vampire/alien team, he is not a werewolf/vampire/alien
(so if he dies he will not cause the team he is on to lose, even though Nostradamus themself won't win).

**Nostradamus is on the team of the last card he looks at (which he taps on the app).
If he does not look at a card or choose a card in the app, the app will choose a team for him.
If a player receives the Nostradamus card from the center cards, he is on the team that the app has chosen for him.**

### Oracle

- Team: Villager

- Team: Special - Villager or Werewolf or Tanner
- Set: Daybreak

Renfield wakes up and sees who the Vampires are and who they are pointing at.
Then Renfield must take the Mark of the Bat and place it in front of him face down, placing his original Mark (without looking at it) face down on the empty Bat spot on the Marks board.
Renfield wins as long as no Vampires are killed, even if Renfield himself dies.

If the Mark of the Bat ends up on another player, it has no effect on that player.

**Renfield is on the vampire team (but he is not a Vampire), unless no players are Vampires (or have the Mark of the Vampire), in which case he is on the villager team.**

### Revealer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Revealer wakes up and may flip any other player's card face up.
If a Werewolf or Tanner is showing, he must flip it over again face down.

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Sentinel wakes upa nd may place a shield token on any player's card except his own.
That card may not be viewed or moved, and may not have an artifact placed on it.

The Sentinel's shield prevents the Witch, Robber, Drunk, and Insomniac from viewing or moving their own card (if it is shielded).
While the Drunk's power is normally mandatory, a shield on the Drunk's card prevents the Drunk from using his power.

During setup, a shield token should be placed near the center cards so the Sentinel can easily reach it.

**The Sentinel is on the village team.**

### Squire

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Bonus

The Squire wakes up and learns who the Werewolves are by having them stick out their thumbs.

The Synthetic Alien wakes up with the aliens. Even though he is an Alien, he has a different win condition.
Due to the self-awareness he is programmed with, he realizes that his advanced technology is too powerful for the aliens to wield, and too dangerous for the villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.

**The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.**

### Tanner

- Set: Werewolf

The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die.
The Tanner only wins if he dies.
If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do *not* win.
If the Tanner dies and the Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too.

The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses.

**The Village Idiot is on the villager team.**

### Villager

Players may often claim to be a villager.

**The Villager is on the village team.**

### Werewolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Werewolf

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves.
If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center

Lone Wolf Option - If there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card. This is extremely beneficial to a Werewolf who doesn't have a partner, and provides him with a useful tool for deceiving the rest of the players.

**Werewolves are on the werewolf team.**

### Witch

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak

The Witch wakes up and may look at one of the center cards.
If she *does* look at a center card, then she *must* exchange that card with any player's card (including her own card),
placing that player's card back in the center (in the same location without looking at it).

**The Witch is on the village team, unless she replaces her own card with a card from a different team.**
