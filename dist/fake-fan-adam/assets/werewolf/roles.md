- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

##  Alien

- Team: Alien
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 1-A

Aliens (including Aliens, Synthetic, Body Snatcher, Groob, and Zerb) wake up and look for each other.

The app may direct the Aliens as to take additional action.
In some cases, the Aliens may have the ability to change a player into an Alien.
In this particular case, the player remains an Alien, regardless of what their card is.

## Alpha Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 2, 2-B
- Prep: Place any Werewolf card (Werewolf, Mystic Wolf, Dream Wolf) face down & perpendicular to the three center cards. 

At night, the Alpha Wolf wakes up with the other Werewolves. 
Afterwards, the Alpha Wolf wakes up separately and they *must* exchange the Center Werewolf card with any non-Werewolf player's card, without looking at either card.
All roles that can view or move a center card may also view or move the Center Werewolf card.

## Apprentice Assassin

- Team: Special - Apprentice Assassin
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -1-B
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Assassin in the Marks Board

The Apprentice Assassin wakes up immediately after the Assassin places the Mark of the Assassin in front of a player,
*while the Assassin's eyes are still open*.
The Apprentice Assassin looks for the Assassin (and the Assassin looks for her).

The Apprentice Assassin wins if the Assassin dies.
The Apprentice assassin does not have to be alive at the end of the game in order to win.

If there is no Assassin, the Apprentice Assassin must place the Mark of the Assassin in front of any player,
and only wins if the player with the Mark of the Assassin (including herself) dies.

**The Apprentice Assassin is on her own team.**

## Apprentice Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 5-B

The Apprentice Seer wakes up and *may* look at one of the center cards. 

## Apprentice Tanner

- Team: Special - Tanner
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 3-B

The Apprentice Tanner wakes up, and the Tanner puts out his thumb so the Apprentice Tanner knows who the Tanner is.

The Apprentice Tanner wins if the Tanner dies (in which case the Tanner wins too).

If there is no Tanner, the Apprentice Tanner realizes that the Tanner job is not all that after all, and only wins if he dies.

**The Apprentice Tanner is on the Tanner team.**

## Assassin

- Team: Special - Assassin
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -1
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Assassin in the Marks Board

The Assassin wakes up and must place the Mark of the Assassin on any player, placing that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down in the empty Assassin spot on the Marks boards.

The Assassin can only win if the player with the Mark of the Assassin dies, regardless of what that player's team is.
The Assassin does not have to be alive at the end of the game in order to win.
The Assassin is unique in that if he wins, other teams can still meet their winning conditions and win, so it is possible to have the assassin win along with the Vampires, the villagers, or even the Tanner.

If it happens that the Assassin ends up with the Mark of the Assassin at the end of the game, he only wins if he himself dies.

**The Assassin is on his own team.**

## Aura Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 7-C

When the Aura Seer wakes up, all players who have (at that point in the night) viewed or moved any card stick out their thumbs.
If a role was called and the player did not view or move a card, that player does not stick out his thumb.

## Beholder

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 9-Z

The Beholder wakes up and learns who the Seer and the Apprentice Seer are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Beholder may then check the cards of the Seer and Apprentice Seer.

## Blob

- Team: Special - Blob
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 13

The Blob doesn't wake up, but is told which and how many players adjacent to it are now part of the Blob.
The Blob wins as long as none of the players who are part of the Blob (including the Blob player) are killed.
The Blob wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

The players the Blob must keep alive are always relative to the location of the Blob card at the end of the game.

**The Blob is on its own team.**

## Bodyguard

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Vote: Whoever they "vote" for cannot be killed.

When everyone votes, the player that the Bodyguard points to cannot be killed. 
If that player received the most votes, the player with the next most votes (at least two) is killed.
Recommended for five or more players.

When the Bodyguard is in the game, it is necessary for all players to turn their cards over right after the vote 
(to see if the Bodyguard is pointing to the player with the most votes).

## Body Snatcher

- Team: Alien
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 1-A, 1-F

The Body Snatcher wakes up with the Aliens, and then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card, and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien, regardless of what team the role was on before.
(If the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien Team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher Card is also an alien.

## Cow

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 1-C

The Cow sticks out their fist while the aliens are awake.
If any alien is sitting next to the Cow, one alien must tap her on the fist, which tips her.

## Copycat

- Team: Special - Any
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -8

The Copycat wakes up and must look at one of the center cards.
From that point on in the game, the Copycat is the role they viewed.
If that role is called, the Copycat wakes up and does that role's action.

The role seen by the original Copycat goes with that card if the Copycat card is moved to another player.

**The Copycat is on the team they first view.**

## The Count

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -6, -6-B
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Fear and the Mark of the Vampire in the Marks Board

The Count wakes up with the Vampires. 
Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire players, taking that player's original Mark 
(without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty vampire spot.

He also wakes up after the Vampires have closed their eyes, and must place the Mark of Fear on any non-Vampire 
(he may not place it on the player who has the Mark of the Vampire, as that player is now a Vampire).
The Mark of Fear prevents a player from using their Night action (if they have one).

## Cupid

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -4
- Prep: Place the Marks of Love in the Marks Board

Cupid wakes up and may place up to two Marks of Love face down in front of any two players,
placing those players' original Marks face down (without looking at them) in the empty Love spots on the Marks boards.

Players who receive the Marks of Love wake up when called after Dusk to learn who they are in love with.
If either player is killed, the other dies as well. 
Players with the Mark of Love remain on their current teams.

## Curator

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 11
- Prep: Place Artifacts near the center cards

The Curator wakes up and may choose and place a random face down Artifact token (without looking at it) on any player's card (including his own).

The Curator may not place an Artifact token on a card that has a shield token on it.

[To learn what each Artifact does, view the "Artifacts" page of the Compendium.](/view/werewolf~artifacts)

## Cursed

- Team: Special - Villager / Werewolf / Vampire
- Set: Bonus

The Cursed is on the village team, unless at least one Werewolf or a Vampire votes for him,
and then he becomes a Werewolf of a Vampire and join the werewolf or vampire team. 
This means that if the Cursed receives the most votes, and at least one of those votes is from a Werewolf or a Vampire, 
the village team will win.

**The Cursed is on the Villager team, unless at least one werewolf or vampire votes for them, in which case the Cursed is on that team.**

## Diseased

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -5
- Prep: Place the Mark of Disease in the Marks Board

The Diseased wakes up and must place the Mark of Disease face down on a player adjacent to them, 
returning that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down to the Marks boards.

Any player who votes for the Diseased player (or the player with the Mark of the Disease) cannot win, even if their team wins.
However, any vote cast against this player still counts, and if the Diseased/Mark of the Disease player gets the most votes, 
they die just like any other player, and players on the winning team who did *not* vote for the Diseased/Mark of the Diseased players win.

## Doppelgänger

- Team: Special - Any
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: -7
- Prep: If playing with Marks, put out the secondary Marks. If playing with a Sentinel, prepare a secondary shield token.

*The Doppelgänger is a very complicated role that changes based on the other roles in the game.*

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one player's card and then changes based on the card they see.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, they are the role that the Doppelgänger originally viewed.

[To learn what each card does to the Doppelgänger, view the "Doppelgänger" page of the Compendium.](/view/werewolf~doppelganger)

**The Doppelgänger's team depends on what card they see.**

## Dream Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak

The Dream Wolf does *not* wake up with the other Werewolves. 
When the Werewolves are called, he sticks out his thumb so that the other Werewolves know who he is.
When playing with the Minion, the Dream Wolf sticks out his thumb during the Minion's night phase.

## Drunk

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: 8

The Drunk is so drunk that they don't remember their role.
They must exchange their Drunk card for any card in the center, but they do *not* look at their new card.

## Empath

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 10-E

The Empath wakes up, and watches as certain players do things (as determined by the app).

## Exposer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 10-B

The Exposer wakes up and may flip one, two, or three of the center cards by turning them over and leaving them that way.
The number of cards turned over is determined by the app.
If the Exposer is told that he may flip two cards, he must flip two or none at all.
If he is told that he may flip three cards, he must flip three or none at all.

## Gremlin

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: 7-D

The Gremlin wakes up and may switch Marks or cards (but not both) between any two players,
but may not look at those Marks or cards.

**The Gremlin is on the villager team.**

## Groob & Zerb

- Team: Alien or Own
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 1-A, 1-D

Groob and Zerb wake up with the aliens, and then wake up together later and look at each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game, they have a different win condition: Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive, and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the village team wins as well, since at least one alien was killed.
Any other aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game, they are on the alien team as normal.

**Groob and Zerb are on the alien team, unless both are in the game, in which case they are on their own teams.**

## Hunter

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf
- Vote: If they die, whoever they voted for dies as well.

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes their target receives).

## Insomniac

The Insomniac wakes up and looks at their card (to see if it has changed).

The Instigator wakes up and may place a Mark of Traitor face down in front of any player,
placing that player's original Mark (without looking at it) face down in the empty Traitor spot on the Marks boards.

A player who receives the Mark of the Traitor only wins if someone *else* on his team is killed.
If the player with the Mark of the Traitor is the only person on his team,
the Mark of the Traitor has no effect.

## Leader

- Team: Special - Village / Leader
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 3-C

The Leader wakes up, and all palyers who are aliens keep their eyes closed and put out their thumbs.
If both Zerb and Groob are in the game and saw each other when they woke up, they point at each other (with their eyes closed) instead of putting out their thumbs.

If Zerb and Groob are *not* both in the game, the Leader wins with the village team.

If both Zerb and Groob are in the game, the Leader is on their own team and only wins both Zerb and Groob are alive at the end of the game.

In addition, the villager team loses and the alien team wins if all players on the alien team (including Zerb and Groob, if either or both are in the game) point to the Leader, even if an Alien is killed.

**The Leader is on the village team, unless Zerb and Groob are both in the game, in which case the Leader only wins if both Groob and Zerb survive.**

## Marksman

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: 5-D
- Prep: Setup the Marks Board

The Marksman wakes up and may view one player's card and/or another player's Mark 
(but not the same player if viewing both a Mark and a card).

- Wake: 4

The Masons wakes up and looks for the other Mason. 

## The Master

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -6
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Vampire in the Marks Board

The Master wakes up with the Vampires. Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one of the other non-Vampire player, taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

The Master's special power occurs during the vote: 
if another Vampire (the regular Vampire, the Count, or the player with the Mark of the Vampire) votes for him, 
the Master is protected and cannot be killed.
Instead, the player with the 2nd most votes (greater than 1) is killed.

## Minion

- Team: Special - Werewolf / Minion
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: 3

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are.
During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. 
The Werewolves don't know who the Minion is.
If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. 
If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (**not** the Minion) dies.

## Mortician

- Team: Special - Mortician
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 13-A

The Mortician wakes up and may look at one, both, or none of their neighbors (based on what the app tells them to do).
The Mortician needs more business, and on top of that they're really lazy, so they win if at least one of their neighbors 
(the players directly adjacent to them) dies.
The Mortician wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

**The Mortician is on his own team.**

## Mystic Wolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 2, 2-C

The Mystic Wolf wakes with the other Werewolves.
Afterwards, the Mystic Wolf wakes up separately and may look at one other player's card.

## Nostradamus

- Team: Special - Any
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 5-E

Nostradamus wakes up and may look at 1, 2, or 3 cards.
The last card he looks at is the team he is on.
When he has looked at his last card, he must tap that role on the app; the app then tells the players Nostradamus's team.

Nostradamus wins if he lives *and* the team he is on wins. If he is on the werewolf/vampire/alien team, he is not a werewolf/vampire/alien
(so if he dies he will not cause the team he is on to lose, even though Nostradamus themself won't win).

**Nostradamus is on the team of the last card he looks at (which he taps on the app).
If he does not look at a card or choose a card in the app, the app will choose a team for him.
If a player receives the Nostradamus card from the center cards, he is on the team that the app has chosen for him.**

## Oracle

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien
- Wake: -9

The App asks the Oracle a question.
She responds by tapping an answer on the app. 
If she does not respond for any reason (including if the card is in the center), the app chooses an answer for her.

## Paranormal Investigator

- Team: Special - Villager / Werewolf / Tanner
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 5-C

The Paranormal Investigator (P.I.) wakes up and may look at cards of up to two other players, one at a time.
If he views a Werewolf or Tanner, he may not view any more cards, and he becomes a Werewolf or Tanner, respectively.

If the P.I. sees the Doppelgänger that saw a Werewolf, he continues looking (he doesn't know what the Doppelgänger saw, and does not become what the Doppelgänger saw, even if they Doppelgänger saw a Werewolf or Tanner).

**The Paranormal Investigator is on the Village team, unless he finds a Werewolf, in which case he joins the werewolf team, or if he finds a Tanner, in which case he becomes a Tanner and only wins if he dies.**

## Pickpocket

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: 6-C
- Prep: Setup the Marks Board

The Pickpocket wakes up and may exchange his Mark for the Mark of another player, and *then* views his new mark.

## Priest

- Team: Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -2
- Prep: Place the Marks of Clarity in the Marks Board

The Priest wakes up and must place a Mark of Clarity in front of himself and may place a Mark of Clarity in front of one other player, 
placing both his and that player's original Mark (without looking at them) face down in the empty Clarity spots on the Marks board.

## Prince

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus

Votes for the Prince do not count. 
If the Prince receives the most votes, the player who receives the next largest amount of votes (greater than one) dies.

## Psychic

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 5-G

The Psychic wakes up and the app tells her to look at one or more cards.
Which cards may be viewed can be different for each game.

## Rascal

- Team: Villager
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 7-F

The Rascal wakes up and the app tells them if they may (or must) move two or more cards.
Which cards may be moved can be different for each game.

## Renfield

- Team: Special - Vampire / Villager
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -6-C

If Renfield is in the game, the Vampires must point at the player with the Mark of the Vampire when they close their eyes, and leave their fingers pointing until Renfield closes his eyes.
Renfield wakes up and sees who the Vampires are and who they are pointing at.
Then Renfield must take the Mark of the Bat and place it in front of him face down, placing his original Mark (without looking at it) face down on the empty Bat spot on the Marks board.
Renfield wins as long as no Vampires are killed, even if Renfield himself dies.

If the Mark of the Bat ends up on another player, it has no effect on that player.

**Renfield is on the vampire team (but he is not a Vampire), unless no players are Vampires (or have the Mark of the Vampire), in which case he is on the villager team.**

## Revealer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 10

The Revealer wakes up and may flip any other player's card face up.
If a Werewolf or Tanner is showing, he must flip it over again face down.
If the Revealer reveals a Doppelgänger or Paranormal Investigator card, he leaves it face up. 
The Revealer only flips one card face up, even if he finds a Werewolf or Tanner.

## Robber

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: 6

The Robber *may* choose to "rob" a player by switching their card with another player's card and looking at their new card.

## Seer

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: 5

The Seer may look either at one other player's card or at two of the center cards (but may not move them).

## Sentinel

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 0
- Prep: Place a shield token near the center cards.

The Sentinel wakes up and may place a shield token on any player's card except his own.
That card may not be viewed or moved, and may not have an artifact placed on it.

The Sentinel's shield prevents the Witch, Robber, Drunk, and Insomniac from viewing or moving their own card (if it is shielded).
While the Drunk's power is normally mandatory, a shield on the Drunk's card prevents the Drunk from using his power.

During setup, a shield token should be placed near the center cards so the Sentinel can easily reach it.

## Squire

- Team: Special - Werewolf / Squire
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 9-C

The Squire wakes up and learns who the Werewolves are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Squire may then view the cards of the Werewolves.
If no players are Werewolves, the Squire wins as long as one other player (*not* the Squire) dies.

## Synthetic Alien

- Team: Special - Synthetic
- Set: Alien
- Wake: 1-A

The Synthetic Alien wakes up with the aliens. 
Even though he is an Alien, he has a different win condition.
His programming leads him to realize that his technology is too powerful for the aliens or villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.
If the Syntehtic dies, everyone of the alien and villager teams lose.

When the app refers to "Aliens" it includes the Synthetic Alien, even though they are on a different team.

**The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.**

## Tanner

- Team: Special - Tanner
- Set: Werewolf

The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die.
The Tanner only wins if he dies.
If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do *not* win.
If the Tanner dies and the Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too.

The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), 
so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses.

**The Tanner is on the Tanner team, not the Werewolf or Villager team.**

## The Thing (That Goes Bump in the Night)

- Team: Villager
- Set: Bonus
- Wake: 4-B

The Thing wakes up and *may* tap the nearest shoulder of either the player on his left or the player on his right.

## Vampire

- Team: Vampire
- Set: Vampire
- Wake: -6
- Prep: Place the Mark of the Fear and the Mark of the Vampire in the Marks Board

Vampires (including Master and Count) wake up and look for other Vampires.
Then the Vampires must place the Mark of the Vampire in front of one other non-Vampire player, 
taking that player's original Mark (without looking at it) and placing it face down on the Marks boards in the empty Vampire spot.

## Village Idiot

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 7-B

The Village Idiot wakes up and may move *all* player's cards but his own one place to the left or move *all* player's cards but his own one place to the right.
When moving cards, they may never move their own card, the center cards, or any cards with a shield token.

## Villager

- Team: Villager
- Set: Werewolf

The Villager has no special abilities.

## Werewolf

- Team: Werewolf
- Set: Werewolf
- Wake: 2

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves.

When playing with the "Lone Wolf" option, if there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card. 

## Witch

- Team: Villager
- Set: Daybreak
- Wake: 6-B

The Witch wakes up and *may* look at one of the center cards.
If they do look at a center card, then they *must* exchange that card with any player's card (including her own),
placing that player's card back in the center (in the same location without looking at it).
