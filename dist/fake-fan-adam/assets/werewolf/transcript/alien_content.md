# One Night Ultimate Alien

In *One Night Ultimate Alien(TM)*,
strange beings from beyond have infiltrated your small village,
bringing fearsome futuristic technology and an insatiable appetite for villagers and their livestock.
Fortunately, your village has powerful inhabitants who have been tasked with saving it from the alien invaders.

In addition to the contents below,
the game includes a free iOS/Android One Night app (which can be obtained via your device's app store, or through the link
on beziergames.com), which creates a dynamic game experience each time the game is played.

## For Players of Other One Night Games

Alien includes changes from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game, its sequel *Daybreak*,
and *One Night Ultimate Vampire*.
Be sure to read the *Getting Started Guide* before you jump in and start playing.
The sections indicated below highlight some things that are new to *Alien*.

**Setup:** *Alien* requires that the device with the app on it is placed where everyone can reach it.
It also requires that each player take a player number token.
See Setup below.

**The One Night App:** Unlike other *One Night* games,
the use of an iOS or Android One Night App is mandatory for *Alien*.
There are several roles taht only work if there's an app, and unlike previous games,
the narration for each role is not shown in the rules.
Fortunately, the One Night app is free (visit beziergames.com on your device for direct links).

**Variable rules for several roles:**
Many roles in the game will have you do different things each time you play.
The app will provide a different set of these rules for each game automatically.

**Multiple teams in the same game:** 
It is possible to have any number of teams playing in a *One Night* game,
such as Aliens and Werewolves.
These Epic Battles are described in detail below.

See the last page of these rules for more information about *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, *Daybreak*, and *Vampire*.

## Setup

When playing *Alien*, you may use any combination of roles, but always include three more role cards than there are players.
Each player receives one card (face down, which they look at secretly).
While you may use any number of Aliens, we recommend using a combination of two Aliens (any two regular Aliens, Groob, or Zerb)
for the best results.

Place the three extra cards in the center of the table face down.

Each player receives a Player Number tokens,
which are numbered form 1 to the number of players playing.
To make things easier for all players,
giving players numbers that increase in a circle around the table (in either direction)
will make it easier to play *Alien*.

## The One Night App

In *Alien*, the app is a critical part of the game.
It provides variable rules for many roles,
tells the players what to do in the case of a ripple in the space-time continuum,
and is also used by several roles that interact with the app during the Night phase.

Download the free One Night app by going to beziergames.com on your iOS or Android device.

### Setting Up the App

After you've downloaded the app,
tap the first button
at the upper left to turn off the *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* roles that are on by default.
Then tap the green *One Night Ultimate Alien* button to turn on the roles for *Alien*.

### Variable Rules

Most roles have variable actions,
resulting in different rules for each of these roles.
Each game, a random action will be used and called out by the app.
Be sure to pay attention to what the app is saying when your role is called.

### Ripples in Space-Time

If there are any Aliens in your game,
there's a chance that their flagrant use of futuristic technology might create a ripple in the space-time continuum.
If that happens, the app will tell you what happens as a result.
The ripples may be as simple as giving a specific player an ability,
or they may be as complex as taking you back in time to repeat the entire night phase again.

Ripples (if they happen) always occur at the end of the night, right before players are asked to move their cards around slightly and then wake up.
Remember that whenever the app asks a role to do something, 
it is always referring to the player who *started* the night with that role.
Even if you know for sure that you no longer have the role you started with,
you will only wake up and do the action associated with your original role.

### App Interactions

Some roles require interaction by players with the app during the night phase.
Most of the time, the app will ask a player to answer a question, or choose something from a small list.
This is done by the player tapping the appropriate response on the app within a few seconds of being asked the question.
The amount of time given to interact with the app is the same length as the role timer.

Sometimes, the app will ask for a player with a certain role to do something, and that role card will be in the center.
If that happens, the app will choose an answer itself.
This ensures that players don't know if a certain role is in the game or not.

## Playing with the Alien Roles

This section describes all of the roles in *One Night Ultimate Alien*,
and also explains how they interact with roles from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game,
its sequel, *Daybreak*, and *One Night Ultimate Vampire*.

For the roles below, "Alien" includes the regular Aliens, Groob, Zerb, and any other card that becomes and Alien
during the Night phase.
If any Alien is killed at the end of the game, the alien team loses.

If you're a *One Night* veteran, play *Alien* first without cards from the other games.
Once you get the hang of how *Alien* works, you can add cards from the other 
*One Night* games (see the section "Using other One Night Games with Alien" for more details on combining the games).

### Oracle

The Oracle wakes up and may resond to the app,
which will ask her a question.
She responds by tapping an answer on the app.
If she does not respond for any reason (including if the card is not given to any player, but is instead in the center),
the app will choose an answer for her.

*The Oracle is on the Village team.*

### Alien

Aliens (including the "regular" Aliens, Synthetic, Groob, and Zerb) wake up
and look for other Aliens. Then the app will direct the Aliens as to what to do next.

In some cases, the Aliens may have the ability to change a player into an Alien.
In this particular case, the *player* remains an Alien, regardless of what his card is.

*The Alien is on the Alien team.*

### Synthetic Alien

The Synthetic Alien wakes up with the Aliens.
Even though he is an Alien, he has a different winning condition.
Due to the self-awareness he is programmed with, he realizes that his advanced technology is too powerful for the aliens to wield,
and too dangerous for the villagers to have, so he only wins if he dies.
If the Synthetic dies, everyone on the alien and villager teams lose.

When the app refers to "Aliens" it includes the Synthetic Alien, even though he is on a different team.

*The Synthetic Alien is on his own team.*

### Cow

The Cow sticks out her fist while the Aliens are awake.
If any Alien is sitting next to the Cow, one Alien must tap her on the fist, which tips her.

*The Cow is on the villager team.*

### Groob & Zerb

Groob and Zerb wake up with the Aliens, and then wake up together later and look at each other.

If both Groob and Zerb are in the game,
they have a different winning condition:
Groob only wins if Zerb dies and Groob stays alive,
and Zerb only wins if Groob dies and Zerb stays alive.
In both cases, the villager team wins as well, since at least one Alien was killed.
Any other Aliens in the game lose if either Zerb or Groob dies.

If only one of the two is in the game,
she is on the alien team as normal.

*Groob and Zerb are on the Alien team, unless both are in the game,
in which case they are on their own teams.*

### Leader

The Leader wakes up,
and all players who are Aliens keep their eyes closed and put out their thumbs.
If both Zerb and Groob are in the game and saw each other when they woke up,
they point at each other (with their eyes closed)
instead of putting out their thumbs.

If Zerb and Groob are *not* both in the game,
the Leader wins with the villager team.
If both of them are in the game, the only way the Leader wins is if both Zerb and Groob
are alive at the end of the game.
In addition, the villager team loses and the alien team wins if all of the players
on the alien team (including Zerb and Groob, if either or both are in the game)
point to the Leader, even if an Alien is killed.

*The Leader is on the villager team, unless Zerb and Groob are both in the game, in which case
the Leader only wins if both Groob and Zerb survive.*

### Psychic

The Psychic wakes up, and is told that she may look at one or more cards by the app.
Which cards may be viewed may be different for each game.

*The Psychic is on the villager team.*

### Rascal

The Rascal wakes up, and is told by the app if he may (or must)
move two or more cards.
Which cards may be moved may be different for each game.

*The Rascal is on the villager team.*

### Exposer

The Exposer wakes up, and may flip
one, two, or three of the center cards by turning them over and leaving them that way.
The number of cards turned over is determined by the app.
If the Exposer is told that he may flip two cards, he must flip two or none at all.
If he is told that he may flip three cards, he must flip three or none at all.

*The Exposer is on the villager team.*

### Blob

The Blob doesn't wake up, but is told which and how many players adjacent to it are
now part of the Blob.
The Blob wins as long as none of the lpayers who are part of the Blob
(including the Blob player) are killed.
The Blob wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

The players the Blob must keep alive are always relative to the location of the Blob card at the end of the game.

*The Blob is on its own team.*

### Mortician

The Mortician wakes up and may look at the cards of one, both, or none of his neighbors (based on what the app tells him to do).
The Mortician needs more business, and on top of that he's really lazy,
so he wins if at least one of his neighbors
(the players directly adjacent to him) dies
(Whether he saw their cards or not).
The Mortician wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

*The Mortician is on his own team.*

## Doppelgänger & Alien

When playing with the Doppelgänger (from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game),
please note the following rules:

**Oracle:**
The Doppelgänger-Oracle wakes up after the Oracle, and answers another question.

**Alien:**
The Doppelgänger-Alien wakes up with the other Aliens.

**Synthetic:**
The Doppelgänger-Synthetic wakes up with the Aliens, and wins if she dies.

**Cow:**
The Doppelgänger-Cow puts out her fist just like the Cow
(both will put their fists out at the same time),
and if an Alien is sitting next to the Doppelgänger-Cow, one of them must tap her.

**Groob or Zerb:**
The Doppelgänger-Groob or Doppelgänger-Zerb wakes up with the Aliens,
and also with Groob and Zerb.
While she must kill the other (Groob if she is Zerb, and Zerb if she is Groob)
in order to win, the real Groob and Zerb may win by killing her if she is the Doppelgänger of their target.
The Leader will only win if Zerb, Groob, and the Doppelgänger of either
are alive at the end of the game.

**Leader:**
The Doppelgänger-Leader wakes up after the Leader and sees who the Aliens are.

**Psychic:**
The Doppelgänger-Psychic wakes up after the Psychic and may look at cards based on what the app tells her.

**Rascal:**
The Doppelgänger-Rascal wakes up after the Rascal and may move cards based on what the app tells her.

**Exposer:**
The Doppelgänger-Exposer wakes up after the Exposer,
and may expose 1 or 2 additional cards based on what the app tells her.

**Blob:**
The Doppelgänger-Blob absorbs players in the same manner as the Blob
(but it will be a different set of players, based on the Doppelgänger-Blob's location).

**Mortician:**
The Doppelgänger-Mortician wakes up after the Mortician and wins if one of her neighbors dies.

## Epic Battles: Aliens vs Villagers vs Werewolves vs Vampires

You can have Aliens, Villagers, Werewolves (from *One Night* and *Daybreak*), and Vampires (from *Vampire*) in the same game.

If three or more of these groups are in the game and active (i.e. actually in front of at least one player, not just in the center card group), at least two players will be killed during the vote: the player with the most votes and the player with the 2nd most votes
(in this case 1 vote counts if it is the 2nd highest number).
If there is a tie for most votes, only those tied for the most votes are killed.
If there isn't a tie for the most votes, and there is a tie for the 2nd most votes,
the person with the most votes is killed and those with the 2nd most votes are also killed.
If it is determined that only two of these groups are in play (because the other cards were in the center),
then only the player(s)
with the most vottes (as long as they have at least 2) are killed.
Both of the win conditions below must be fulfilled for each team to win:

- Alien Team
  - At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Vampire must be killed
  - No Aliens may be killed
- Vampire Team
  - At least 1 Werewolf or 1 Alien must be killed
  - No Vampires may be killed
- Villager Team
  - At least 1 player from two different teams must be killed
- Werewolf Team
  - At least 1 Vampire or 1 Alien must be killed
  - No Werewolves may be killed

It is possible, when four teams are in play, to have more than one team win.
For instance, if a Villager and a Vampire are killed, both the alien team and the werewolf team win.
Colluding with another team to try to get the numbers is encouraged,
but it might just out you and result in your team losing!

All other teams retain their original win conditions.
