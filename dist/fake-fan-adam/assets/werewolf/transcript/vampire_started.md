# One Night Ultimate Vampire

## Getting Started Guide

In *One Night Ultimate Vampire*,
each player takes on a role on either the vampire team or the village team.
It's your job to figure out who the Vampires are and to kill at least one of them in order to win...
unless you've become a Vampire yourself!

Unlike many other games, the real fun in *Vampire* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night,
where each of the players may have performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on (because your role card might have been switched or you may have
been bitten by a Vampire),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who isn't on your team; the player(s) that receives the most votes is "killed."
If a Vampire is killed, everyone on the village team wins.
If *no* Vampires are killed, everyone on the vampire team wins.

The more you play *Vampire*, the more you'll realize
how important it is to wait until just the right time to reveal information,
and how important it can be to lie,
regardless of what team you started on.

Because the game is so short,
you'll probably end up playing multiple games.
Because *Vampire*
is so different, it may take a few games until you get into the flow of figuring out what to say when,
and soon you'll realize that events of previous games have an undeniable impact on the current game in terms of how players behave,
who they believe, and what their real motivations are.

## First Game Setup

Setup differs based on the number of players.
For your first game, it's recommended that you play a 4 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay.
If you have more players, don't worry-
the game is very quick and everyone else will enjoy watching.

Place the Marks boards in the middle of the table,
with Marks that correspond to each of the spots face up.
Turn the Vampire, Fear, and 2 Clarity Marks face down 
(always turn the Marks in use face *down*, leaving the ones not in play face *up*).

Give each player a face down Mark of Clarity.
Leave unused Marks of Clarity in the game box.

Include the following cards:

- 1 Copycat
- 1 Vampire
- 1 The Count
- 1 Priest
- 1 Marksman
- 1 Pickpocket
- 1 Gremlin

Shuffle these cards face down in the center of the table,
and place tokens for *all* of the cards nearby so everyone can reach them.

Each player should secretly view their card,
and place it and their Mark of Clarity face down near the three cards in the center of the table.
All players should be able to reach all cards easily,
as shown on the page:

[Image: Three cards in the center, surronded by four cards, each with a face down Mark. 7 tokens are next to the center cards. The Marks board is on one edge, with only the marks of the assassin, love, traitor, disease, and bat facing up.]

## The Free App

While you can play *Vampire* without the free app,
it's much more fun if you have it (go to beziergames.com for a link to the free app).
The scripts that are shown here can be used if you don't have access to an iOS or Android device,
and also to allow you to become more familiar with the roles.
If you don't have the app, one player (who also has a role card) is the Announcer and announces each of the roles in order and
silently counts to ten after each role is woken up to allow the player(s) with that role to perform their action.

To use this app, simply select the roles that are in the game,
and press the Play button...
the app will do the rest for you.

## Dusk

Each night is broken into two parts: Dusk and Night.
During both parts, all players will have their eyes closed.
When a player's role is called, they will open their eyes and do a specific action tied to that role.

There are several roles that are called on to do a Dusk action.
During this time, players who are not active (whose eyes are closed)
may not move, point, or do anything to communicate with the active player(s).

At the end of the Dusk phase,
players will be able to open their eyes and view their Marks to see if they're changed during Dusk.
This is the last time players will be able to view their MArks until the end of the game.

Here is the Dusk portion of the script for your first 4-player game:

> Announcer: "Everyone, close your eyes"
>
> *All players close their eyes, (including the Announcer).*
>
> "Copycat, wake up and look at one of the center cards. You are now that role. If that role is called, wake up and do that action."
>
> *The Copycat opens his eyes and must look at one of the center cards. He becomes that role and will wake up again later if that role has a Dusk or Night action.*
>
> "Copycat, close your eyes. Vampires, wake up and look for other Vampires. Give any non-Vampire player a Mark of the Vampire."
>
> *The Vampires (including the Count) open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open. One of them silently replaces a non-Vampire player's Mark with the Mark of the Vampire and places the player's original Mark in the Vampire spot on the Marks boards.*
>
> "Vampires, close your eyes. Count, wake up and place the Mark of Fear in front of any non-Vampire player."
>
> *The Count opens his eyes and must replace a non-Vampire's Mark with a Mark of Fear, and places the player's original Mark in the Fear spot on the Marks boards.*
>
> "Vampires, close your eyes. Priest, wake up and give yourself a Mark of Clarity. You may also give any other player a Mark of Clarity."
>
> *The Priest opens his eyes and exchanges his Mark (without looking at it) for a Mark of Clarity. He may also exchange any other player's Mark (without looking at it) for a Mark of Clarity. His original Mark and the player's original Mark are placed in the Clarity spots on the Mark's boards.*
>
> "Priest, close your eyes. Everyone, wake up and secretly view your Mark."
>
> *All players open their eyes and secretly view their Mark*

## Night

After players have viewed their Marks,
they all close their eyes again and the players who have night action roles take their turns.

If a player who would normally have a night action sees the Mark of Fear,
he may not wake up when his role is called.

Here is the Night portion of the script for your first 4-player game:

> Announcer: "Everyone, close your eyes."
>
> *All players close their eyes (including the Announcer).*
>
> "Marksman, wake up. You may view the Mark of one lpayer, and the card of another player."
>
> *The player with the Marksman card opens his eyes and may quietly look at the Mark of one player, and the Card of another player.*
>
> "Marksman, close your eyes. Pickpocket, wake up. You may exchange your Mark with antoher player's Mark, and then view your new Mark."
>
> *The player with the Pickpocket card opens his eyes and may quietly exchange his Mark with the Mark of another player, and then views his new Mark.*
> 
> "Pickpocket, close your eyes. Gremlin, wake up. You may switch Marks or cards between any two players."
>
> *The player with the Gremlin card opens his eyes and may switch Marks or cards between any two players (but may not view them).*
>
> "Gremlin, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and move your card around slightly. Everyone, wake up!"
>
> *All players open their eyes and look around suspiciously*

## Day

After the Night phase, players discuss amongst themselves who they believe the Vampires are.
All players may say anything, but may never show their card or Mark to anyone (or look at their card or Mark themselves).
Vampires usually want to claim to be a different role so they don't die.

A player with the Mark of the Vampire is a Vampire and is now on the Vampire team (even if that Mark was moved to the player without his knowledge).
The Mark of the Vampire changes the team of the player, but that player is still able to perform his card's night action.

Whatever card was viewed by the Copycat (even a Vampire)
is now the role of the Copycat card, even if it is in front of a person who did not start with the Copycat card.

Because certain roles (like the Gremlin) change other players' cards or Marks,
some players will believe they are one role, when they are actually a different one.

After the night phase, your role is determined by the card and Mark that are currently in front of you,
which may be different than your original role.
*No one may look at any cards or Marks after the night phase.*

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote by pointing at another player
(players may never point at themselves or away from all players).

> "Everyone: three, two, one, VOTE!"
>
> *Each player points to another player.*

The player with the most votes dies and reveals his card.
In the case of a tie,
all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.
If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies.
One way the players might achieve this is if everyone votes in the same direction around the table, with each
player receiving one vote (decide this as a group before you vote).

## Game End

After just one night and one day...

The village team wins:

- 1) If at least one Vampire (including the Count and any player with a Mark of the Vampire) dies. Even if one or more players who are *not* Vampires die in addition to a Vampire dying, everyone on the village team wins.
- 2) If no one is a Vampire or the Count and no one dies. This is possible if both the Vampire and the Count cards are in the center and if the Copycat does not view either of those cards.

The Vampire team (Vampire and the Count) only wins if at least one player is a Vampire or the Count and no Vampires are killed.

## Other Tips

The length of time it takes for discussion during the Day phase is up to the players.
When using the app, set the game timer to 1 minute less than the number of players;
when the timer goes off, everyone must vote for another player.
This adds a sense of urgency to the discussions, and will result in less non-relevant conversations during the day.

To prevent the Marks boards from being moved at nighttime by excited/nervous players,
place removable double-sided tape on the bottom of the Marks boards so they don't slide around.
You can also orient the Marks boards with their backs up against each other instead in a long line depending on table space.

For the roles that wake and look for each other,
you can also stick out your thumb when waking;
this makes it easier for everyone who wakes to spot the other players who are awake.

## Using Other Roles

To use additional roles in subsequent games just take out a card and replace it with a different one.
You may use virtually any combination of cards, though you probably don't want to introduce 
more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time, so players can easily understand them.

Regardless of which roles are present, you must always have 3 more cards than players.

Be creative with your role selection:
Try having a single Vampire, or shuffling *all* of the cards and dealing them out to players entirely randomly!
