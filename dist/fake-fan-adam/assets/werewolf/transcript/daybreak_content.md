# One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak*,
there's been an outbreak of werewolves in your town,
and all of them have special powers.
Fortunately, the village has all sorts of amazing roles to help them figure out
who those werewolves are!

## Playing with the Daybreak Roles

This section describes all of the roles in *Daybreak*, and also explains
how they interact with the roles from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game.

For the roles below, "Werewolf" includes the Alpha Wolf,
Mystic Wolf, and Dream Wolf.

If you're a *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* veteran,
add a few of the *Daybreak* roles to each game until you become comfortable with them.

## Roles that Wake Up at Night

### Sentinel

The Sentinel wakes up and may place a shield token on any player's card except his own.
That card may not be viewed or moved, and may not have an artifact placed on it.

The Sentinel's shield prevents the Witch, Robber, Drunks, and Insomniac from viewing or moving their own card
(if it is shielded). While the Drunk's power is normally mandatory, a shield
on the Drunk's card prevents the Drunk from using his power.

During setup, a shield token should be placed near the center cards so the Sentinel can easily reach it.

*The Sentinel is on the village team.*

> "Sentinel, wake up. You may place a shield token on any player's card but your own."
>
> *The Sentinel opens his eyes and may place a shield token on any player's card but his own.*
> 
> "Sentinel, close your eyes."

### Alpha Wolf

If playing with the Alpha Wolf,
position any other Werewolf card (including a regular Werewolf,
the Mystic Wolf, or Dream Wolf)
face down and perpendicular to the three center cards (see the setup image under "First Game Setup" in the Getting Started Guide
for an example of where to place the Center Werewolf Card).
At night,
the Alpha Wolf wakes up seperately.
The Alpha Wolf *must* exchange the Center Werewolf card with any other player's card
(but not his own card or another Werewolf's card), without looking at either card.

All roles that can view or move a center card may also view or move the Center Werewolf card.

*The Alpha Wolf is on the Werewolf team.*

> "Alpha Wolf, wake up and exchange the Center Werewolf card for any other player's card."
>
> *The Alpha Wolf opens his eyes and exchanges the Center Werewolf card with another player's card.*
>
> "Alpha Wolf, close your eyes."

### Mystic Wolf

The Mystic Wolf wakes with the other Werewolves.
Afterwards, the Mystic Wolf wakes up seperately. The Mystic Wolf may look at one other player's card.
*The Mystic Wolf is on the Werewolf team.*

> "Mystic Wolf, wake up. You may look at another player's card."
>
> *The Mystic Wolf opens her eyes and may quietly look at one other player's card.*
>
> "Mystic Wolf, close your eyes."

### Apprentice Seer

The Apprentice Seer wakes up and may look at one of the center cards.
*The Apprentice Seer is on the village team.*

> "Apprentice Seer, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards."
>
> *The player with the Apprentice Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one of the cards in the center.*
>
> "Apprentice Seer, close your eyes."

### Paranormal Investigator

The P.I. wakes up and may look at the cards of up to two other players, one at a time.
If he views a Werewolf or a Tanner, he may not view any more cards,
and he becomes a Werewolf or a Tanner, respectively.

If the P.I. sees the Doppelgänger that saw a Werewolf or Tanner,
he continues looking (he doesn't know what the Doppelgänger saw,
and does not become what the Doppelgänger saw, even if the Doppelgänger saw a Werewolf or Tanner).

*The Paranormal Investigator is on the village team,
unless he finds a Werewolf, in which case he joins the Werewolf team,
or if he finds a Tanner,
in which case he becomes a Tanner and only wins if he dies.

> "P.I., wake up. You may look at up to two cards of other players. If you see a Werewolf or the Tanner, you must stop, and you become a Werewolf or a Tanner."
>
> *The player with the P.I. card opens his eyes and may quietly look at up to two other player's cards. If he sees a Werewolf or the Tanner, he stops looking and becomes a Werewolf or the Tanner.*
>
> "P.I., close your eyes."

### Witch

The Witch wakes up and may look at one of the center cards.
If she *does* look at a center card, then she must echange that card with any player's card (including her own card),
placing that player's card back in the center (in the same location) without looking at it.
If the Witch gives herself a role that wakes up later in the night, she does *not* wake up again.

*The Witch is on the village team, unless she replaces her own card with a card from a different team.*

> "Witch, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards. If you do, you must echange that card with any player's card."
>
> *The player with the Witch card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one of the cards in the center. If she does, she must exchange that card with any player's card.*
>
> "Witch, close your eyes."

### Village Idiot

The Village Idiot wakes up and may move *all* players' cards but his own one place to the left or move *all*
players' cards but his own one place to the right.
If he chooses to move cards, he must always move all player's cards except his own card,
the center cards, and any cards with a shield token on them.

*The Village Idiot is on the Village team.*

> "Village Idiot, wake up. You may move everyone's card but your own to the left or to the right."
>
> *The player with the Village Idiot card opens his eyes and may quietly move everyone's card but his own, the center cards, or a card with a shield token on it to the left or to the right.*
>
> "Village Idiot, close your eyes."

### Revealer

The Revealer wakes up and may flip any other player's card face up.
If a Werewolf or Tanner is showing, he must flip it over again face down.
If the Revealer reveals a Doppelgänger or P.I., he leaves it face up.
The Revealer only flips one card face up, even if he finds the Werewolf or Tanner.

*The Revealer is on the Village team.*

> "Revealer, wake up. You may flip over any other player's card. If it is a Werewolf or Tanner, flip it over face down."
>
> *The player with the Revealer card opens his eyes and may quietly flip another player's card over so it is face up. If it is a Werewolf or the Tanner, it must be flipped again face down.*
>
> "Revealer, close your eyes."

### Curator

The Curator wakes up and may choose and place a random face down Artifact token (without looking at it)
on any player's card (including his own).
See the list on the opposite page for tokens and their effects.

The Curator may not place an Artifact token on a card that has a shield token on it.

*The Curator is on the village team.*

> "Curator, wake up. You may place an Artifact token face down on any player's card."
>
> *The player with the Curator card opens his eyes and chooses one of the face down Artifact tokens and places it on any player's card.*
>
> "Curator, close your eyes."

## No-Wake Roles

### Bodyguard

When everyone votes, the player that the Bodyguard points to cannot be killed.
If that player received the most votes, the player with the next most votes (at least two)
is killed.
Recommended for five or more players.

When the Bodyguard is in the game,
it is necessary for all players to turn their cards over right after the vote
(to see if the Bodyguard is pointing to the player with the most votes).

*The Bodyguard is on the village team.*

### Dream Wolf

The Dream Wolf does *not* wake up with the other Werewolves.
When the Werewolves are called,
he sticks out his thumb so that the other Werewolves know who he is.
When playing with the Minion, the Dream Wolf sticks out his thumb duirng the Minion's night phase.
*The Dream Wolf is on the Werewolf team.*

When playing with the Dream Wolf, the announcer should wake the Werewolves slightly differently:

> "Werewolves, except for the Dream Wolf, wake up and look for other Werewolves. Dream Wolf, stick out your thumb."
> 
> *The Werewolves (except for the Dream Wolf) open their eyes
> and look for anyone else whose eyes are open.
> The Dream Wolf sticks out her thumb, so the Werewolves know who he is.*
> 
> "Dream Wolf, put your thumb away. Werewolves, close your eyes."

## Artifacts

There are different Artifact Tokens that can be placed on any player's card by the Curator.
When the night phase is over, any player with an Artifact token on his card must immediately secretly look at his token.
A player with an Artifact token may not show that token to anyone else.
However, they may say anything about that token that they want to: 
they may say what it actually is, they may lie, etc.

All Artifact tokens override the card they are placed on; the Artifacts that change your role
also take away any special power you might have at the end of the game (for instance,
if your card is the Bodyguard and you receive the Brand of the Villager, 
the person you point at gets a vote and is not protected, because you are a Villager and not a Bodyguard anymore).

Artifact tokens that change a player's role also remove the Hunter's power 
and the Tanner's winning condition if the token owner had one of those cards.

A token that is the same as your card (for instance,
receiving a Claw of the Werewolf token on top of your Werewolf card)
doesn't really do anything.
However, you often can't be sure if your card was changed; but if it has, the token overrides that.

During setup, all of the Artifact tokens should be placed face down and shuffled, and the stack of face-down Artifact tokens
should be placed near the center cards so the Curator can easily reach them.

You may choose to include only some of the Artifacts instead of all of them, based on your personal preference.

The following is a list of Artifacts:

**Claw of the Werewolf:**
You are now a Werewolf.

**Brand of the Villager:**
You are no a Villager, with no special abilities.

**Cudgel of the Tanner:**
You are now a Tanner.
You only win if you die.
If you die, the werewolf team cannot win.
If a Werewolf *and* you both die, both you and the village team wins.

**Void of Nothingness:**
This artifact has no effect.

**Mask of Muting:**
You may not speak. You may use hand motions, sign language, etc. as long as you are silent.

**Shroud of Shame:**
You must turn your chair, body, and face
away from the other players.
You may still speak,
but you may not look at the other players
or the cards and tokens.
You may not turn around when voting,
but you may (try to) point at any player
(the other players will determine who you pointed at).

## Doppelgänger and Daybreak

Even though your group of players might be very comfortable using the Doppelgänger with the original
*One Night Ultimate Werewolf* roles,
we suggest that you play *without* the Doppelgänger before playing with her.

The Doppelgänger does the following based on what she sees (roles marked with ! are night actions that the Doppelgänger does immediately):

**Sentinel!:**
The Doppelgänger-Sentinel may immediately place a shield token on another player's card (not her own).

**Alpha Wolf!:**
The Doppelgänger-Alpha Wolf immediately exchanges the Center Werewolf card with any player except hers or the Alpha Wolf's
(but does not look at either card).
When the Werewolves are called, the Doppelgänger-Alpha Wolf wakes up with the rest of the Werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Alpha Wolf is called.

**Mystic Wolf!:**
The Doppelgänger-Mystic Wolf may immediately look at any player's card.
When the werewolves are called, she wakes up with the rest of the Werewolves.
She does *not* wake up when the Mystic Wolf is called.

**Apprentice Seer!:**
The Doppelgänger-Apprentice Seer may immediately view one of the center cards.
She does *not* wake up when the Apprentice Seer is called.

**Paranormal Investigator!:**
The Doppelgänger-P.I. may immediately look at other players' cards,
one at a time, up to two of them.
If she sees a Werewolf or Tanner she must stop, and then she becomes a Werewolf or a Tanner.
She does *not* wake up when the P.I. or Werewolves are called.

**Witch!:**
The Doppelgänger-Witch may immediately look at a center card, and if she does that she must exchange
it for any player's card without looking at that player's card.
She does *not* wake up when the Witch or Werewolves are called.

**Village Idiot!:**
The Doppelgänger-Village Idiot may immediately move all player cards to the left or right.
She does *not* wake up when the Village Idiot is called.

**Revealer:**
The Doppelgänger-Revealer wakes up towards the end of the night,
immediately after the Revealer goes to sleep, and may flip over any player's card that is face down;
if that card is a Werewolf or Tanner, it must be flipped back over face down.
She does *not* wake up when the original Revealer is called.

**Curator:**
The Doppelgänger-Curator wakes up towards the endo fthe night,
immediately after the Curator goes to sleep, and may place an Artifact token
face down on any player's card,
except a card that already has a shield or another token on it.
She does *not* wake up when the original Curator is called.

**Bodyguard:**
She is now that role and does nothing else at night.
When it comes time to vote,
the Doppelgänger-Bodyguard's "vote"
protects whichever player she is pointing at.

**Dream Wolf:**
The Doppelgänger-Dream Wolf is on the Werewolf team but she does not wake with the other Werewolves,
but instead puts her thumb out when the Werewolves are called at night.

The script for the Doppelgänger is more complex depending on which *Daybreak* roles you have in place.
If she sees a no-wake role
(Bodyguard or Dream Wolf) or a regular  night actin role 
(Sentinel, Alpha Wolf, Mystic Wolf, Apprentice Seer, P.I., Witch, Village Idiot),
you may use the standard script from the original *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game.
If she views the Revealer or the Curator,
she'll need to wake up again right after those roles wake up.

If the Revealer and Doppelgänger are both in play, use the following Script after the Revealer:

> "Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Revealer card, wake up and turn any card face up.
> If the card you reveal is a Werewolf or a Tanner, turn it back over face down."
>
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and turns over any player's card.
> If it is a Werewolf or a Tanner, she flips it over face down again.*
>
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

If the Curator and Doppelgänger are both in play,
use the following Script after the Curator:

> "Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Curator card, wake up and place an Artifact token on any card."
>
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and places an Artifact token face down on any player's card which 
> does not already have a token on it.*
>
> "Doppelgänger, close your eyes."

## Playing with More than 10 Players

If you have more than 10 players who want to play,
and you have both *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*
and *Daybreak*,
consider splitting into two groups, with each group playing a separate game.

If you want to have a giant game with more than 10 people all playing together,
you'll want one person who isn't playing to stand/sit near the cards to show/move cards as each player wakes up.
When a player wakes up, they point to the card(s) to be shown/moved,
and the non-player does that action for them.
Trying to fit more than 10 people around a table where everyone wants to reach the center of the table can be challenging otherwise.

## Fun Scenarios

While you can mix any set of roles together and still have a great time playing,
the following are a few sets that we've found particularly engaging
during hundreds of playtest sessions.
The player counts are the minimums; you can add other roles to these sets to match the number of players
(remember you need 3 more cards than players).

### At least 3 players

**Evil Transformation:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Mystic Wolf, Minion, Robber, Witch

**Trust No One:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Dream Wolf, Robber, Witch, Tanner

### At least 4 players

**Cautionary Tale:** Werewolf, Mystic Wolf, Seer, Apprentice Seer, Revealer, Hunter, Bodyguard

### At least 5 players

**Information Society:** Werewolf, Mystic Wolf, Seer, Apprentice Seer, Paranormal Investigator, Witch Insomniac, Revealer

**Total Chaos:** Doppelgänger, Alpha Wolf, Werewolf, Robber, Witch, Troublemaker, Village Idiot, Curator

## Night Wake Order with Daybreak & One Night

The following is a list of all the roles that are woken at night from both the original 
*One Night Ultimate Werewolf* game as well as *Daybreak*, and the order they should be woken relative to each
other (only call the roles that are in your game):

- #0: Sentinel
- #1: Doppelgänger
- #2: Werewolves
  - #2-B: Alpha Wolf
  - #2-C: Mystic Wolf

- #10: Revealer
- #10a: Doppelgänger-Revealer
- #11: Curator
- #11a: Doppelgänger-Curator

The Villagers, the Tanner, and the Hunter from *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* are never woken up at night.
The Bodyguard and Dream Wolf from *Daybreak* are never woken up at night.
