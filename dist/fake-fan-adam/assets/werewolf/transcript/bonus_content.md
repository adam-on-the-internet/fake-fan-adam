# Bonus Roles

## Roles

### Aura Seer

When the Aura Seer wakes up,
all players who have (at that point in the night) viewed or moved any card stick out their thumbs.
If a role was called and the player did not view or move a card, that player does not stick out his thumb.

The Aura Seer is woken up after the Troublemaker (*One Night*) or Village Idiot (*Daybreak*).
*The Aura Seer is on the Village Team.*

> "Aura Seer, wake up. Everyone: If you have viewed or moved any card, stick out your thumb."
>
> *The player with the Aura Seer card opens her eyes.
> All players who have either viewed or moved any card stick out a thumb for the Aura Seer to see.*
> 
> "Everyone, put your thumbs away. Aura Seer, close your eyes."

### Cursed

The Cursed does not wake up at night.
The Cursed is on the village team, unless at least one Werewolf or a Vampire votes for him, and then he becomes a Werewolf
or a Vampire and joins the werewolf or vampire team.
This means that if the Cursed receives the most votes, and at least one of those votes is from a Werewolf or a Vampire,
the village team will win.

### Prince

The Prince does not wake up at night.
Votes for the Prince do not count.
If the Prince receives the most votes, the player who receives the next largest amount of votes
(greater than one) dies.
*The Prince is on the village team.*

### Apprentice Tanner

The Apprentice Tanner wakes up, and the Tanner puts out his thumb
so the Apprentice Tanner knows who the Tanner is.

The Apprentice Tanner wins if the Tanner dies (in which case the Tanner wins too).

If there is no Tanner, the Apprentice Tanner realizes that the Tanner job is not all that after all,
and only wins if he dies.

*The Apprentice Tanner is on the Tanner team.*

> "Apprentice Tanner, wake up. Tanner, stick out your thumb so the Apprentice Tanner can see who you are."
>
> *The Apprentice Tanner opens his eyes, and then the Tanner sticks out his thumb.
>
> "Apprentice Tanner, close your eyes."

### Beholder

The Beholder wakes up and learns who the Seer and Apprentice Seer are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles,
the Beholder may then check the cards of the Seer and Apprentice Seer.

*The Beholder is on the Villager team.*

> "Beholder, wake up. Seer (and Apprentice Seer), stick out your thumb.
> Beholder, you may view the Seer's card."
>
> *The Beholder opens her eyes, and then Seer (and Apprentice Seer) sticks out her thumb.
> The Beholder may view the Seer's card (and Apprentice Seer's card).*
>
> "Beholder, close your eyes."

### Squire

The Squire wakes up and laerns who the Werewolves are by having them stick out their thumbs.
Just to make sure they haven't been switched with other roles, the Squire may then view the cards of the Werewolves.
If no players are Werewolves, the Squire wins as long as one other player (*not* the Squire) dies.

*The Squire is on the Werewolf team.*

> "Squire, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb.
> Squire, you may view the Werewolves' cards."
>
> *The Squire opens his eyes, and then the Werewolves stick out their thumbs.
> The Squire may view the Werewolves' cards.*
>
> "Squire, close your eyes."

### The Thing (That Goes Bump in the Night)

The Thing wakes up and may tap the nearest shoulder of either the player on his left or the player on his right.

*The Thing is on the villager team.*

> "Thing, wake up. You may tap the shoulder of the player on your right or on your left."
>
> *The Thing opens his eyes, and then may tap the shoulder of either the player on his left or right.*
>
> "Thing, close your eyes."

### Body Snatcher

The Body Snatcher wakes up with the Aliens, and then wakes up again by himself later.
The second time he wakes up, he must take a card from a non-Alien player, look at that card,
and then place his Body Snatcher card face down in front of the player he stole from.
The card he stole is now an Alien,
regardless of what team the role was on before
(if the card moves, the player who has the card at the end of the game is an Alien and is on the Alien team.)
The player who has the Body Snatcher card is also an Alien.

*The Body Snatcher is on the alien team.*

### Nostradamus

Nostradamus wakes up and may look at 1, 2, or 3 cards.
The last card he looks at is the team he is on.
When he has looked at his last card, he must tap that role on the app;
the app then tells the players Nostradamus's team.

Nostradamus wins if he lives *and* the team he is on wins.
If he is on the werewolf/vampire/alien team, he is not a werewolf/vampire/alien
(so if he dies he will not cause the team he is on to lose,
even though Nostradamus himself won't win).

*Nostradmus is on the team of the last card he looks at
(which he taps on the app).
If he does not look at a card or choose a card in the app, 
the app will choose a team for him.
If a player receives the Nostradamus card from the center cards,
he is on the team that the app has chosen for him.*

### Empath

The Empath wakes up, and watches as certain players do things
(as determined by the app).

*The Empath is on the villager team.*

### Ricochet Rhino

If Richochet Rhino has the most players pointing at him,
the player he is pointing at is caught instead of him
(regardless of how many votes his target receives).

*Ricochet Rhino is on the hero team.*

### Family Man

Family Man doesn't wake up, but is told which and how many players adjacent to him are now members of his family.
Family Man wins as long as none of the players who are part of Family Man (including the Family Man player) are caught.
Family Man wins in addition to any other teams that might win.

The players Family Man must keep alive are always relative to the location of the Family Man card at the end of the game.

*Family Man is on his own team.*

### Defender-er

When everyone votes,
the player that the Defender-er poitns to cannot be caught.
If that has the most players pointing at him,
the player who is pointed at the most after that player (greater than one) is caught.

When the Defender-er is in the game,
it is necessary for all players to turn their cards over right after the vote 
(to see if the Defender-er is pointing to the player who has the most players pointing at him).

*The Defender-er is on the hero team.*

### The Sponge

The Sponge does not wake up at night.
Players who point at the Sponge do not count.
If the Sponge has the most players pointing at him,
the player who is pointed at the most after the Sponge
(greater than one) is caught.

*The Sponge is on the hero team.*

### Windy Wendy

Windy Wendy does not wake up at night.

Windy Wendy is on the hero team,
unless at least one villain votes for her, 
and then she becomes a villain and joins the villain team.
This means that if Windy Wendy has the most players pointing at her,
and at least one of those players is a villain,
a villain has been caught.

### Innocent Bystander

This is an additional Innocent Bystander with the same rules as the Innocent Bystander in *Super Villains*.

*The Innocent Bystander is not a hero, but he is on the hero team.*

## Doppelgänger & Bonus Roles

The Doppelgänger does the following based on what she sees
(the role marked with a ~ is an action that the Doppelgänger does immediately):

**Aura Seer:**

She does *not* wake up when the original Aura Seer is called.

and sees what everyone is doing.

**Nostradamus:** The Doppelgänger-Nostradamus

## Special Cases

he is a vampire, and no longer has his special ability;
he can be killed.

If the Tanner has the Mark of Fear (*Vampire*),
he still puts his thumb out when the Apprentice Tanner wakes.

If the Seer or Apprentice Seer has the Mark of Fear (*Vamire*),
she still puts her thumb out when the Beholder wakes.

If any Werewolf has the Mark of Fear (*Vampire*),
he still puts his thumb out when the Squire wakes.
