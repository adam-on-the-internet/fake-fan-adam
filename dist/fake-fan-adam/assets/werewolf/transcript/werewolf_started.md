# One Night Ultimate Werewolf

## Getting Started Guide

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, each player takes ont he role of a Villager,
a Werewolf, or a special character.
It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win...
unless you've become a Werewolf yourself!

Unlike many other games, the real fun in *One Night* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night,
where many of the players performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on (because your role card might have been switched with another role card),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who *isn't* on your team; the player that receives the most votes is "killed."
If a Werewolf is killed, everyone on the village team wins.
If no Werewolves are killed, the Werewolf team wins.

The more you play *One Night*, the more you'll realize how important it is to wait until just the riht time to reveal information,
and how important it can be to lie, regardless of what team you started on.

Because the game is so short, you'll probably end up playing multiple games.
Because *One Night* is so different, it may take a few games until you get into the flow of figuring out what to say when,
and soon you'll realize that events of previous games have an undiable impact on the current game in terms of how players behave,
who they believe, and what their real motivations are.

## First Game Setup

Setup differs based on the number of players (3-10).
For your first game, it's recommended that you play a 3-5 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay
(If you have more, don't worry. The game is very quick and everyone else will enjoy watching).

Include the following cards:

### 3 Players

- 2 Werewolves
- 1 Seer
- 1 Robber
- 1 Troublemaker
- 1 Villager

### 4 Players

- +1 Villager

### 5 Players

- +2 Villagers

There should always be three more cards than the number of players.
Shuffle the selected cards face down and deal one to each player.
Put the remaining three cards and tokens that match all the cards being used in the middle of the table.

Each player should secretly view their card, and place it face down near the three cards in the center of the table.
All players should be able to reach all cards easily, as shown in the example for 5 players below:

(image: 3 cards in the center surronded by 5 cards surronding them. 8 tokens near the center.)

## Night

There are several roles that are called on at night to do a night action.
However, players with a Villager, Tanner, or Hunter card *never* wake up at night.

In addition to having a role card, one player is is designated the Announcer and announces each of the roles in order and silently counts to ten after each role is woken up to allow the players with that role to perform their action at night.
Use this script with the previously suggested cards:

> Announcer: "Everyone, close your eyes."
>
> *All players close their eyes (including the Announcer).
>
> "Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves."
> 
> *The Werewolves open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others).*
> 
> "Werewolves, close your eyes. Seer, wake up. You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards."
> 
> *The player with the Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one other player's card or any two of the cards in the center.*
> 
> "Seer, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange your cards between two other players."
> 
> *The player with the Troublemaker card opens her eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two other players without looking at those cards.*
> 
> "Troublemaker, close your eyes."
> 
> *The Announcer, keeping his eyes closed, moves the cards around slightly (this ensures no one can claim a card was moved/inspected because it is no longer in its original position).*
> 
> "Everyone, Wake up!"
> 
> All players open thier eyes and look around suspicously.

## Day

After the night phase, players discuss amongst themselves who they believe the Werewolves are.
All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone.
Werewolves might want to claim to be a different role so that they don't die.

Because certain roles change other players' cards, some players will believe they are one role,
when they are actually a different one.
After the night phase, your role is the card that is currently in front of you, which may be different then your original role.
*No one may look at any cards after the night phase.*

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.

> "Everyone, three two, one, VOTE!"
> 
> *Each player points to another player*

The player with the most votes dies and reveals his card.
In the case of a tie, all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.

If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies.
One way the players might achieve this is if everyone votes in the same direction around the table,
with each player receiving one vote (decide this as a group before your vote).

## Game End

After just one night and one day...

The village team wins:

- 1) If at least one Werewolf dies, even if one or more players who are not Werewolves die in addition to a Werewolf dying,
everyone on the Village team wins.

- 2) If no one is a Werewolf and no one dies, it is possible for noe one to be a Werewolf if all Werewolf cards are in the center.

The Werewolf team only wins if at least one player is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.

If you are playing with the Tanner, there are special rules regarding who wins; see the Tanner's role description for details.

## Get the Free App

Instead of having an Announcer, you can simply use the free app for mobile devices available at www.beziergames.com.
This app calls out the roles you're using in order, provides some background noise, and also has a timer for the day phase.
You can even set it to move quickly once players are comfortable with all the roles.

The app works on both Android and iOS devices and is completely free!

The app is highly recommended; even though it's not required, it's very beneficial to use it.
The app also provides narration for the sequel:
*One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak*.

## Using Role Tokens

*One Night Ultimate Werewolf* includes role tokens that match each of the cards.

During the day phase of the game, players can use the tokens to help them deduce players' roles by placing appropriate tokens on top of cards that they've "verified".

Having the role tokens that are in play during each game near the center of the table allows everyone to see which roles (and how many of each) are in the current game.
The numbers on the tokens correspond in the night wake order.

If you aren't using the App (though you really should), you can place the tokens being used in front of the player who is the Announcer,
so that he can quickly determine the night order of the roles to call out.

## Announcer Tips

The best tip is to *get the free app*.
However, there are times when this isn't possible, so here is some advice for announcing:

As the Announcer, place any tokens with numbers on them near you in ascending order,
and open your eyes in between roles if you need to check the night order.
Otherwise keep your eyes closed during the night.
You may want to tap on the table during the night to mask any sounds made by players when they are looking at and moving cards.
If you call your own role, don't speak while performing your action.

When introducing players to the game for the first time,
or introducing new roles,
be sure to pause during the "action" seciton of each role you call to give players enough time to decide what to do and to complete their action.

## Other Tips

It's not uncommon for the first few games of One Night to start the day phase with people looking at each other. wondering what to say.

To get things started, you might want to offer a limited amount of information, such as "I'm the Seer but I'm not going to say what I looked at... yet," or "I started as the Robber, but I exchanged *someone's* card...once some other people start talking I'll tell you whose it is."

Knowing how all the roles in the game work is really important if you're a Werewolf, as you'll have to lie initially about who you are and what did (if anything).
It's easy to lie and say you are a Villager, but it's often more effective to boldly claim to be another role before the "real" owner does;
there's a chance that role is a center card,
and if it isn't, the "real" owner of that role may have a hard time convincing other players what he is, since you claimed the role first.

While honesty may be the best policy in real life, in *One Night*, even if you started on the villager team, it can lead to your downfall.
For instance, claiming you are the Robber and that you stole a Villager card from some one may get everyone to
believe you (if the player you stole from verifies he was indeed a Villager to start with), but if the Troublemaker switched your card with a Werewolf,
you'll be voted out easily, with no credible defense available to you.
Instead, waiting just a little bit to learn if your card was indeed switched by the Troublemaker would give you the opportunity to lie and say you started as a Werewolf, and now the person you were switched with is a Werewolf (even if the opposite is true).

The more that you play *One Night*, the more fun it will be to devise a web of lies and simultaneously unravel the truth.
As your ability to deceive and figure things out increases, so will the abilities fo other players,
making each game more and more interesting.
And when roles are changed between games, you'll discover that your strategies will evolve even further.

With larger groups, you'll need a bit more time for daytime discussion than with smaller groups.
After a few plays consider using a timer; when the timer goes off, everyone must vote.
This adds a sense of urgency to the discussions, and will result in less non-relevant conversations during the day.

Playing with higher player numbers (7+) can make it difficult for everyone to reach the middle of the table.
STanding at the table during the Night phase can make reaching easier, and using a smaller table can also help.
If you have to use a long "banquet" table, try to position the players on the long sides of it, and *not* the ends.
