# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Rules

- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

- 4-10 players (Best with 6-8)
- 10 minutes per game
- Social Deduction

In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf*, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or another special character.
It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win... unless you've become a werewolf yourself!

Unlike many other games, the real fun in *One Night* is figuring out exactly what happened over that one night, where many of the players
performed some sort of special action.
You'll need to figure out what team you're on (because your role card might have been switched with another role card),
and then figure out what teams the other players are on.
At the end of each game you'll vote for a player who *isn't* on your tea; the player that receives the most votes is "killed".
If a Werewolf is killed, everyone on the village team wins. 
If no Werewolves are killed, the Werewolf team wins.
