# One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Wake-Up Order

- [Back to Compendium](/fake-fan-adam/view/werewolf~compendium)

Some (not all) Roles wake up during the Night, and some take actions.
There is a set order to the Roles waking up, and that order is sometimes important to find out what happened.

The Wake-Up Order number is also noted on the Role Tokens included with the game.
